However, we believe this number is skewed due to the high percentage of retirees in the area. ","88.1% of Henderson County high school students graduate, according to ACCESSNC.  This includes adult high school and GED completions. ","According to the US Census Quickfacts, Henderson County had a poverty rate of 13.8% in 2016, an increase from the previous data report.   ","According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2003 (the most recent available), 10 percent of Henderson County adults lack ""basic"" prose literacy skills. That same source reveals that 1 out of 4 adults in Henderson County cannot read above a fifth grade level. ",,"In PY18, Blue Ridge Literacy Council served 345 individuals with 135 volunteer tutors. Of the 302 adults we served, 60% increased their literacy skills, with 42% receiving a Measurable Skills Gain, 5 received their High School Equivalency (HSE), and 17 obtained a post-secondary certificate. Post-secondary certificates were all nationally recognized and included career pathways in healthcare, hospitality, or education. Additionally, 100% of students achieved one or more of their individual goals.","BRLC has an increase of students who are seeking our services to gain a professional employment position including nursing, teaching, and guest services. Approximately, 17 (20%) of our ESL students hold professional degrees or certifications from their home country, and the number of our ABE students who are seeking their High School Equivalency to pursue self-sustaining careers or post-secondary education has increased from 15% to 24%, 9 students currently. Our program objectives for EmployED are that 70 students will be in this focused program between May 2019 and April 2020, and of those 42 will increase their literacy skills, 28 will receive a federally defined Measurable Skills Gain, and a minimum of 14 will receive a post-secondary credential. To reach these objectives, EmployED also has to focus on recruiting retired professionals from various career pathways to tutor students according to their focused career goals. For example, we currently have a physician from Cuba who we cannot match without the proper tutor recruitment process for identifying a retired physician who can come alongside him. If we do not properly support this motivated group of individuals they will be unemployed or underemployed, thus lack the resources to be self-sustainable and live a more meaningful life. During this program period 50 potential tutors will participate in our introduction to programming, with 30 going on to training and being matched with EmployED adult learners. ","EmployED seeks to transform lives through improved English and Communication skills for adult learners who have SMART goals related to a specific professional field, earning a HSE, or admission into post-secondary programs. These students participate in an in-take process where they are interviewed, their goals discussed and outlined, and their current literacy and English communication skills evaluated utilizing CASAS or TABE. Concurrently we recruit retired professionals through newspaper ads and articles, speaking at civic group meetings, and other targeted marketing. Perspective tutors participate in Mission Monday, an introduction to our Mission and programs. Of those participants that wish to tutor, a six hour hands-on tutor training is required. We then match tutors with adult learners based on the student's goals and the volunteer's professional background and availability. Tutors are offered on-going support from Program Coordinators including in-service workshops. Once the student and tutor reach 40-60 hours of instruction the CASAS or TABE is administered to ensure improvements. HSE practice tests are also utilized. Supplemental materials related to the students' professional goals, such as professional journals, practice nursing exams, specialized curriculum, etc. are purchased and provided to the student and tutor for free. ","This program operates on an open enrollment schedule. We currently have 35 EmployED students on our waiting list. We will launch a tutor recruitment campaign in May 2019. We hope to have all 70 students matched by September of 2019 with 60 hours of instruction completed by March 2019. Post-testing will take place in April 2019. Throughout this time some students will sit for national credentials, the HiSET, and other post-secondary exams.","Students are tested twice a year using the TABE or CASAS to measure progress. Tutors turn in progress reports monthly, and complete a more thorough goal setting process in the spring of each year. Certificates of achievement are reported, such as passing a section of the HSE, receiving a nationally recognized certificate, etc. Each Student's progress is also noted through face-to-face interviews with tutors or staff to assess goal achievements in various areas, including: Got a Job; Got a Better Job/Promotion or Raise; Retained Employment; Increased My Income, among other life and educational goals. Students' achievements, study hours, test scores, and tutor notes are all entered into our program database. The attendance sheets for the workshops and progress reports from the digital literacy programs are also entered. We then run quarterly reports and mid-year reports to ensure that goals are being met.","Our space consists of a small library, open study area, and three private study rooms. We are able to use the local community college's classrooms and county library study rooms. Tutor training and in-service training takes place at the Community College. All training, tutoring, and educational materials are given free of charge to both the student and tutor. The materials we have available are reviewed during tutor training with a more comprehensive review prior to the match meeting where the tutor meets their student(s). The primary curricula we use comes from New Readers Press and includes, but is not limited to: *Step Forward, a five-level, comprehensive competency-based ESOL (English as a Second Language) series that integrates all language skill areas. *Endeavor, a six-book series focusing on vocabulary building, reading and writing. *At Work in the U.S., a beginning to intermediate workbook for job-related English.*ESL for Job Success, which focuses on soft skills and workplace culture.*Put English to Work, a multi-level series published by Contemporary.*Achieving TABE Success Workbooks in Reading and Math designed to help students learn and improve basic, intermediate, and advanced skills.   *Kaplan Comprehensive Test Prep Book for GED and HiSET.*Scoreboost Booklets for HiSET prep, in each of the 5 Subjects.*Professional related journals, textbooks, etc. will also be used purchased by BRLC including practice tests. ","We utilize technology whenever possible. Digital literacy is incorporated into each of our student's learning plans. We currently have four Chromebooks and two iPads available for students to checkout. We keep laptops at the library branches for the students and tutors to use in the study rooms during their tutor sessions. We also have four laptops that are available in our open study area for use with headphones. Each of our private study rooms has a computer in them. We utilize multiple online programs that enhance the learning process and prepare students for on-line testing, such as the HSE. We are currently researching conference software that our students and tutors can use to meet remotely, and we are preparing to purchase a robust ELA software program that we will use to keep students engaged as they wait to be matched with a tutor.  Our aim is to have a set of on-line software choices so that we can have something appropriate for our wide variety of student skill sets and goals.  We are also trying to identify smartphone apps that are relevant to our programs and student needs.We explain to our tutors the technology available to them and/or their student(s) during the student/tutor match meeting.

However, a report by the Prison Policy Initiative recently found that 27% of ex-offenders, or returning citizens, are unemployed. That means 1 out of every 4 formerly incarcerated individuals are looking for work but cannot find a job, which is almost five times higher than the unemployment rate for the general United States population (Out of Prison & Out of Work, July 2018). ","Based on the fact that individuals enrolled in LSSI's Literacy Program read below a sixth grade reading level, we can assume that almost all of them dropped out of school. According to a study conducted by Northwestern University, 51% of the incarcerated population between the ages of 18 and 34 in 2010 were dropouts (High School Dropouts in Chicago and Illinois: The Growing Labor Market, Income, Civic, Social and Fiscal Costs of Dropping Out of High School, November 2011). ","A study by the Brookings Institution found that boys who grew up in families who earned in the bottom 10% (about $14,000 annually) are twenty times more likely to be in prison in their 30s than boys born into families who earn $143,000 or more. They also found that the men from families in the lowest income bracket make up about 27% of prisoners who are in their 30s (Work and Opportunity Before and After Incarceration, March 2018). ","Studies have found that almost half of prisoners read below a sixth grade level (Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform, December 2016). Additionally, LSSI has first-hand experience with literacy rates in prisons through our Prisoner and Family Ministry programs, such as through the Storybook Project, where LSSI saw incarcerated individuals struggling to read basic books to their children.",,"With $15,000, LSSI can provide 50 incarcerated individuals with tutoring and materials needed to increase their reading levels. Tutors will use Language Olympic books provided by LSSI to teach reading levels. LSSI expects that we will be able to increase student reading levels by at least one grade for every 12 months they participate in the program. ","With skilled leadership and staff, tangible goals, and strong relationships, LSSI believes we are the best organization to implement a Literacy Program throughout the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) system. The objectives of this program include increasing increasing student reading levels, increasing the number of tutors and students, expanding the number of prisons where this program takes place. We hope that by implementing a Literacy Program across Illinois, we can make a significant impact on those affected by incarceration. ","LSSI's Prisoner and Family Ministry Literacy Program provides incarcerated individuals the opportunity to gain literacy skills through a peer-to-peer learning model. The program began in August 2018, launching in Centralia and Pinckneyville Correctional Facilities, where LSSI worked with prison staff to identify individuals who test at or above a 10th grade reading level on the TABE test and would be willing to become tutors. Once identified, tutors go through a training process with LSSI staff. When individuals sign up to be tutored, they are given the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT), a well-regarded screening to determine their reading level. LSSI then uses Language Olympic books to teach grade one through six reading levels. Students are SORT tested every other month to monitor their progress and TABE tested by IDOC staff. LSSI staff and volunteers oversee the program; however, with a peer-to-peer model, both tutors and students benefit from the program. Tutors are paid by the prison and have a job to put on their resumes, while pupils have a mentor and learn the necessary skill of reading, which will help them reintegrate into society. Since its implementation, the program has enrolled 35 students. In the first half of 2019, LSSI plans to expand to two additional correctional centers. Due to strong support from the Illinois Department of Corrections, prisons across the state have expressed interest in implementing this program. ","LSSI is currently in two prisons, and we plan to expand to three prisons each year over the next three years, which will significantly increase the number of people we can serve. Each student receives 1-2 hours of instruction per week and will typically be enrolled in the program for at least a year, depending on their reading level when they enter the program.",LSSI tests participants with the SORT test every other month to gauge their reading level. The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) TABE tests incarcerated individuals enrolled in education programs on a quarterly basis. ,"LSSI goes into the prisons, where there is space allocated for educational programs.

This will not go toward any administrative time.$500 for transportation -- LSSI's Prisoner and Family Ministry staff are based out of both Marion and East St. Louis, Illinois and have to travel to the prisons where the Literacy Programs are conducted, so this money will be used exclusively for mileage reimbursement.

Without adequate education, it is impossible for a woman to support herself and her family and maintain economic independence. ",,"Mercy Learning Center's Literacy and Life Skills Program is a 32-year old program that has educated and empowered over 13,000 women.  The program's objectives are to provide women with the opportunity to learn English, advance their educations, earn a high school diploma and gain essential life skills like financial and health literacy. During the 2017-2018 program year. Mercy Learning Center educated and empowered 884 women in the Literacy and Life Skills Tutoring Program. ","Mercy Learning Center's motto, ""Educate a Woman...Educate a family,"" speaks to the life-changing impact that our programs have on generations of family members. Increasing women's educational levels through their work with our instructors and tutors provides our adult female students with essential workforce skills and increased employability. According to the U.S. Department of labor, in 2017, individuals with a high school diploma earned 39 percent more per week on average than individuals without a high school diploma. Further, mothers' education levels are proven to have a profound effect on children's educational achievement and health outcomes. The success of Mercy Learning Center's Tutoring Program is measured by tracking both short-term and long-term outcomes. Academic progress is measured while women are actively enrolled in the program. Both during enrollment and after graduation, women's life skills achievements are tracked -- including employment, post-secondary education, citizenship and community participation, and family related accomplishments.  ","The Literacy and Life Skills Tutoring Program is Mercy Learning Center's original program. Each woman in the program is matched with a volunteer tutor and taught basic skills throughout the course of an academic year. The student and tutor meet for 4 hours a week and work through a range of content areas. The levels progress from English Language Acquisition, to Adult Basic Education (levels I, II, III), to GEDÂ® and NEDPÂ® prep. Women also have access to computer instruction each week, with a focus on computer literacy as well as employment skills. Mandatory life skills workshops are held throughout the year on topics such as nutrition, emergency preparedness and financial literacy. The desired outcomes for women in the Literacy and Life Skills Tutoring Program:*	Become fluent in English.*	Advance their basic education skills in order to support and assist their children in their own educations.*	Gain the confidence and life skills to successfully navigate social systems (employment,             health, education, housing, legal, civic).*	Gain and maintain living wage employment and/or secure more economic             stability.*	Achieve a 4-point gain annually in their tutored subject as measured by the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS).*	Earn a high school equivalency diploma through either the GEDÂ® or the NEDPÂ®.*	Transition successfully to college or other post-secondary education or job training programs.","The Literacy and Life Skills Tutoring Program runs year round, with the exception of the first two weeks of July and the last week of December. The Tutoring Program carefully matches each volunteer tutor with a small group of students. The tutors and students meet for four hours per week throughout the year, allowing students to work around the demands of work and home. Tutored students follow the same adult education curriculum as the Intensive Study students, with a focus on math, reading, civics/social studies, science, writing, computer technology (minimum of an additional two hours per week), and family literacy.","The following evaluation measures are used by Mercy Learning Center to assess student outcomes and program impact:*	Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS): A nationally-recognized testing program that evaluates students' reading and math abilities, CASAS is used three times a year to evaluate student progress, chart improvement, reevaluate student competencies and assess program efficacy in a quantifiable manner.*	Tracking student and graduate achievements: Achievements include milestones that contribute to a woman's overall well-being and self-sufficiency such as: getting a new job; earning a job promotion; obtaining a professional certification; gaining college acceptance and scholarships; graduating from college; obtaining U.S. citizenship; getting a driver's license; etc.*	Surveys and evaluations: MLC also evaluates its programs and impact through ongoing informal conferences with students, tutors, volunteers and staff.  Surveys are distributed and evaluation workshops are held for students and volunteers each May.  All staff members complete program evaluations each December and May.","MLC is fortunate to own its building which is a fully renovated and restored former school.
