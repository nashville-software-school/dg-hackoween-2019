However, we believe this number is skewed due to the high percentage of retirees in the area. ","88.1% of Henderson County high school students graduate, according to ACCESSNC.  This includes adult high school and GED completions. ","According to the US Census Quickfacts, Henderson County had a poverty rate of 13.8% in 2016, an increase from the previous data report.   ","According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2003 (the most recent available), 10 percent of Henderson County adults lack ""basic"" prose literacy skills. That same source reveals that 1 out of 4 adults in Henderson County cannot read above a fifth grade level. ",,"In PY18, Blue Ridge Literacy Council served 345 individuals with 135 volunteer tutors. Of the 302 adults we served, 60% increased their literacy skills, with 42% receiving a Measurable Skills Gain, 5 received their High School Equivalency (HSE), and 17 obtained a post-secondary certificate. Post-secondary certificates were all nationally recognized and included career pathways in healthcare, hospitality, or education. Additionally, 100% of students achieved one or more of their individual goals.","BRLC has an increase of students who are seeking our services to gain a professional employment position including nursing, teaching, and guest services. Approximately, 17 (20%) of our ESL students hold professional degrees or certifications from their home country, and the number of our ABE students who are seeking their High School Equivalency to pursue self-sustaining careers or post-secondary education has increased from 15% to 24%, 9 students currently. Our program objectives for EmployED are that 70 students will be in this focused program between May 2019 and April 2020, and of those 42 will increase their literacy skills, 28 will receive a federally defined Measurable Skills Gain, and a minimum of 14 will receive a post-secondary credential. To reach these objectives, EmployED also has to focus on recruiting retired professionals from various career pathways to tutor students according to their focused career goals. For example, we currently have a physician from Cuba who we cannot match without the proper tutor recruitment process for identifying a retired physician who can come alongside him. If we do not properly support this motivated group of individuals they will be unemployed or underemployed, thus lack the resources to be self-sustainable and live a more meaningful life. During this program period 50 potential tutors will participate in our introduction to programming, with 30 going on to training and being matched with EmployED adult learners. ","EmployED seeks to transform lives through improved English and Communication skills for adult learners who have SMART goals related to a specific professional field, earning a HSE, or admission into post-secondary programs. These students participate in an in-take process where they are interviewed, their goals discussed and outlined, and their current literacy and English communication skills evaluated utilizing CASAS or TABE. Concurrently we recruit retired professionals through newspaper ads and articles, speaking at civic group meetings, and other targeted marketing. Perspective tutors participate in Mission Monday, an introduction to our Mission and programs. Of those participants that wish to tutor, a six hour hands-on tutor training is required. We then match tutors with adult learners based on the student's goals and the volunteer's professional background and availability. Tutors are offered on-going support from Program Coordinators including in-service workshops. Once the student and tutor reach 40-60 hours of instruction the CASAS or TABE is administered to ensure improvements. HSE practice tests are also utilized. Supplemental materials related to the students' professional goals, such as professional journals, practice nursing exams, specialized curriculum, etc. are purchased and provided to the student and tutor for free. ","This program operates on an open enrollment schedule. We currently have 35 EmployED students on our waiting list. We will launch a tutor recruitment campaign in May 2019. We hope to have all 70 students matched by September of 2019 with 60 hours of instruction completed by March 2019. Post-testing will take place in April 2019. Throughout this time some students will sit for national credentials, the HiSET, and other post-secondary exams.","Students are tested twice a year using the TABE or CASAS to measure progress. Tutors turn in progress reports monthly, and complete a more thorough goal setting process in the spring of each year. Certificates of achievement are reported, such as passing a section of the HSE, receiving a nationally recognized certificate, etc. Each Student's progress is also noted through face-to-face interviews with tutors or staff to assess goal achievements in various areas, including: Got a Job; Got a Better Job/Promotion or Raise; Retained Employment; Increased My Income, among other life and educational goals. Students' achievements, study hours, test scores, and tutor notes are all entered into our program database. The attendance sheets for the workshops and progress reports from the digital literacy programs are also entered. We then run quarterly reports and mid-year reports to ensure that goals are being met.","Our space consists of a small library, open study area, and three private study rooms. We are able to use the local community college's classrooms and county library study rooms. Tutor training and in-service training takes place at the Community College. All training, tutoring, and educational materials are given free of charge to both the student and tutor. The materials we have available are reviewed during tutor training with a more comprehensive review prior to the match meeting where the tutor meets their student(s). The primary curricula we use comes from New Readers Press and includes, but is not limited to: *Step Forward, a five-level, comprehensive competency-based ESOL (English as a Second Language) series that integrates all language skill areas. *Endeavor, a six-book series focusing on vocabulary building, reading and writing. *At Work in the U.S., a beginning to intermediate workbook for job-related English.*ESL for Job Success, which focuses on soft skills and workplace culture.*Put English to Work, a multi-level series published by Contemporary.*Achieving TABE Success Workbooks in Reading and Math designed to help students learn and improve basic, intermediate, and advanced skills.   *Kaplan Comprehensive Test Prep Book for GED and HiSET.*Scoreboost Booklets for HiSET prep, in each of the 5 Subjects.*Professional related journals, textbooks, etc. will also be used purchased by BRLC including practice tests. ","We utilize technology whenever possible. Digital literacy is incorporated into each of our student's learning plans. We currently have four Chromebooks and two iPads available for students to checkout. We keep laptops at the library branches for the students and tutors to use in the study rooms during their tutor sessions. We also have four laptops that are available in our open study area for use with headphones. Each of our private study rooms has a computer in them. We utilize multiple online programs that enhance the learning process and prepare students for on-line testing, such as the HSE. We are currently researching conference software that our students and tutors can use to meet remotely, and we are preparing to purchase a robust ELA software program that we will use to keep students engaged as they wait to be matched with a tutor.  Our aim is to have a set of on-line software choices so that we can have something appropriate for our wide variety of student skill sets and goals.  We are also trying to identify smartphone apps that are relevant to our programs and student needs.We explain to our tutors the technology available to them and/or their student(s) during the student/tutor match meeting.

However, a report by the Prison Policy Initiative recently found that 27% of ex-offenders, or returning citizens, are unemployed. That means 1 out of every 4 formerly incarcerated individuals are looking for work but cannot find a job, which is almost five times higher than the unemployment rate for the general United States population (Out of Prison & Out of Work, July 2018). ","Based on the fact that individuals enrolled in LSSI's Literacy Program read below a sixth grade reading level, we can assume that almost all of them dropped out of school. According to a study conducted by Northwestern University, 51% of the incarcerated population between the ages of 18 and 34 in 2010 were dropouts (High School Dropouts in Chicago and Illinois: The Growing Labor Market, Income, Civic, Social and Fiscal Costs of Dropping Out of High School, November 2011). ","A study by the Brookings Institution found that boys who grew up in families who earned in the bottom 10% (about $14,000 annually) are twenty times more likely to be in prison in their 30s than boys born into families who earn $143,000 or more. They also found that the men from families in the lowest income bracket make up about 27% of prisoners who are in their 30s (Work and Opportunity Before and After Incarceration, March 2018). ","Studies have found that almost half of prisoners read below a sixth grade level (Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform, December 2016). Additionally, LSSI has first-hand experience with literacy rates in prisons through our Prisoner and Family Ministry programs, such as through the Storybook Project, where LSSI saw incarcerated individuals struggling to read basic books to their children.",,"With $15,000, LSSI can provide 50 incarcerated individuals with tutoring and materials needed to increase their reading levels. Tutors will use Language Olympic books provided by LSSI to teach reading levels. LSSI expects that we will be able to increase student reading levels by at least one grade for every 12 months they participate in the program. ","With skilled leadership and staff, tangible goals, and strong relationships, LSSI believes we are the best organization to implement a Literacy Program throughout the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) system. The objectives of this program include increasing increasing student reading levels, increasing the number of tutors and students, expanding the number of prisons where this program takes place. We hope that by implementing a Literacy Program across Illinois, we can make a significant impact on those affected by incarceration. ","LSSI's Prisoner and Family Ministry Literacy Program provides incarcerated individuals the opportunity to gain literacy skills through a peer-to-peer learning model. The program began in August 2018, launching in Centralia and Pinckneyville Correctional Facilities, where LSSI worked with prison staff to identify individuals who test at or above a 10th grade reading level on the TABE test and would be willing to become tutors. Once identified, tutors go through a training process with LSSI staff. When individuals sign up to be tutored, they are given the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT), a well-regarded screening to determine their reading level. LSSI then uses Language Olympic books to teach grade one through six reading levels. Students are SORT tested every other month to monitor their progress and TABE tested by IDOC staff. LSSI staff and volunteers oversee the program; however, with a peer-to-peer model, both tutors and students benefit from the program. Tutors are paid by the prison and have a job to put on their resumes, while pupils have a mentor and learn the necessary skill of reading, which will help them reintegrate into society. Since its implementation, the program has enrolled 35 students. In the first half of 2019, LSSI plans to expand to two additional correctional centers. Due to strong support from the Illinois Department of Corrections, prisons across the state have expressed interest in implementing this program. ","LSSI is currently in two prisons, and we plan to expand to three prisons each year over the next three years, which will significantly increase the number of people we can serve. Each student receives 1-2 hours of instruction per week and will typically be enrolled in the program for at least a year, depending on their reading level when they enter the program.",LSSI tests participants with the SORT test every other month to gauge their reading level. The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) TABE tests incarcerated individuals enrolled in education programs on a quarterly basis. ,"LSSI goes into the prisons, where there is space allocated for educational programs.

This group is disproportionately composed of people of color (61%) who continue to face discrimination in hiring. In the past 25 years, there has been no decline in hiring discrimination against people of color, white applicants receive 36% more callbacks than black applicants and 24% more than Latino applicants with identical rÃ©sumÃ©s (HBR, 2017).","Montgomery County's overall dropout rate was 9% in 2017. While the Latinx dropout rate has been falling nationally however, it has been rising in MCPS and is now at an all-time-high of 22%, while black students have a 12% dropout rate. This is in stark contrast to the less than 1% dropout rate of white students and correlates to what we see in the unemployed adults we serve, of whom 61% are people of color, and 60% have either not received a high school diploma or higher education. ","Nearly 7% of Montgomery County residents live below the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) and 18% live at 200% of the FPL (American Community Survey, 2016). When the learners we serve do find employment, they are often stuck in low-wage low-skill jobs that do not provide opportunities for them to upskill and improve their opportunities. Without access to adult basic education and GED Prep classes, these adults find themselves fastened to earning lower average wages. ","In Montgomery County, 11% of the population age 16 and older lack basic prose literacy skills. Youth of color in our area are less than half as likely to graduate high school English proficient than their white counterparts -- a major barrier to economic opportunity (Maryland State Board of Education). Fifty-one percent of Montgomery County residents living in poverty are Limited English Proficient (ACS, 2016) and 29% of the unemployed adults are Limited English Proficient (Brookings, 2017). ",,"To meet this need and fill a critical gap in existing community services, in spring of 2018 LCMC launched our GED Prep Class program to provide educational instruction to adults stuck at academic levels well beneath high school level. With the GED Prep Class program's expansion in 2019, we will benefit a total of 260 low-income adults who are basically literate but need educational training to get the GED they need to obtain work or qualify for a college work certificate program.","LCMC will consider our program a success if we have supported low-income adult learners in obtaining the skills they need to achieve employment and economic mobility.In 2019, LCMC aims to accomplish the following outcomes: *	Serve 260 adult learners.*	65 will complete a minimum of one of the four sections of GED*	172 of learners will demonstrate a learning gain. *	208 of learners enrolled will demonstrate learner persistence. *	208 of learners will achieve one or more individual academic goals by the end of the class. Since being launched six months ago, we have grown the program from one to five sites and served over 110 under-skilled and underserved at-risk youth, immigrants, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients working towards their GEDs. LCMC is committed to the continued expansion of the GED Prep Classes program during the coming year and plans to serve four locations in Montgomery County where need is highest and educational services are lowest. ","The adults we serve have limited flexibility, low-incomes, and are locked out of or mistrusting of services that already exist. They also often are at an academic level that is too high for literacy programs but too low for traditional GED prep classes. We created a curriculum that can take anyone from a 4th grade reading level and get them GED-Ready. We do this using what we call the Learning Lab approach--a flexible, data-driven way of teaching that brings high standards to learners who need nothing short of that. Keeping tutoring at the core is an effective way to serve learners who have limited schedule flexibility, have special learning needs that may make it hard for them to learn in a traditional classroom, or who have not attended school before. In the Learning Lab we have a Master Teacher who serves as a consistent face for our learners on-site at locations throughout the region overseeing and managing volunteer tutors who are assigned that day to help students work towards their GED. Our Master Teacher calls each learner before class to provide an extra push to help them show up, provides personal support to tutors if they have difficulty explaining a lesson, and follows up again at the end of each class. By having both a master teacher and tutors in the room, we are able to efficiently and effectively provide the highest quality instruction in a way that is sustainable for a program of our size. ","The timeline for the program is May 1, 2019 Â­ April 30, 2020. Learners receive individualized GED tutoring from our trained volunteers who meet with groups of no more than two pupils two times a week. The Tutoring sessions run year-round, and students are encouraged to attend a minimum of four hours weekly (two classes).","We will measure and evaluate the success of the GED Prep Classes program using the following data sources:-Attendance records measure demonstrated learner persistence; -Weekly reports from tutors working with students;-Standardized pre and post-testing using CASAS Work and Life test demonstrate academic gains;-Pre- and post-class surveys will be administered to measure achievement of learners' personal goals (vote for the first time, stabilize housing, apply for family-sustaining work, etc.); -LCMC's Learning Management System (LMS) which creates benchmarks specific to learners and their needs, so we can more efficiently move them towards completing their goals; and,-Post-graduation levels of employment and income. Although individual learner progress is influenced by many factors outside of the program's control (prior educational background, time spent on homework, etc.), we examine the measurable outcomes in aggregate to identify issues requiring attention. We also conduct observations of tutors to identify issues that might be discouraging learners from attending. ","LCMC's services are conducted throughout the county. Tutors meet with their students in one of the tutor rooms in LCMC's office in Rockville, or in another public space, most often libraries or community centers. Tutor information session and trainings are offered in libraries and online.","In 2018, LCMC implemented a new Learning Management System (LMS) to support programs across the organization. So far, the LMS has allowed staff to create completely customized learning tracks for new students we serve, which has been vital since our students come to us with extremely varied levels of academic experience and ability. The LMS is allowing us to create benchmarks specific to learners and their needs, and more efficiently move them towards completing their goals. This has helped our learners stay motivated while giving staff a clear view of each student's progress or challenges so supportive services can be provided as needed. In 2019 we will begin to use the LMS to reach students outside of the classroom via online instruction. Distance learning mitigates a number of challenges faced by our target population, including inflexible work schedules, securing childcare, and the cost of transportation. It also reduces several programmatic expenses associated with serving an increased number of students, such as additional instructors and program space. Though vital to expanding our ability to educate some of the county's hardest-to-reach and hardest-to-teach, online learning will only supplement our other methods of instruction, never replace them. We have partnered with the education technology companies Schoology, Cell-Ed, and Burlington English to provide online, anytime-anywhere learning opportunities to 70% of our advanced ESL and GED learners.

These goals could include, but are not limited to, acquiring a GED, reading to a child, or getting a better job. Adults who enter OLC's program receive a 45-minute assessment to determine their reading level, reading strengths and weaknesses, and tutoring availability. After the assessment, OLC's immediate goal is to match the student with an appropriate tutor within 30 days. After being matched, students receive free weekly, hour-long tutoring sessions from a trained volunteer tutor in a public location.

One-on-one tutoring sessions are a research-supported best practice for teaching literacy. OLC also uses evidence-based curriculum.Tutors are the key to the success of this program. OLC volunteer tutors complete a six-hour long instructor led training session before obtaining a student. Through regular communication with the Program Director, tutors receive further instruction in working with their particular student as they report on hours tutored and weekly progress. ","OLC's one-on-one tutoring is its main program. Thanks to partnerships over the past few years enabling OLC to increase its visibility in the community, OLC is on a significant growth curve in both the adult and student tutoring programs.

The majority are day laborers in jobs that are temporary or seasonal and this data may not be accurately reflected in Bureau of Labor Statistics.  ","The graduation rate at Morristown High school is 83.7.  Different subgroups account for the rate, e.g., late entry, special education, bi-lingual, etc. The GED program shares our facilities and is offered through Morris County Vocational School.

Our curriculum consists of three levels, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced with a goal of achieving verbal and written communicative competence in real-life settings. Content is organized into themes to include work, family, home, school and community. Lesson plans are focused on developing reading, writing, speaking and listening skills within each unit. Our strategies include technology to help students gain skills to safely search the internet for jobs and write resumes. A cultural component raises awareness and sensitivity to speakers of other languages and broadening the focus to community literacy. The economic well-being of immigrant and low-income minority families that we serve depends on their ability to understand and access multiple systems and structures such as employment, medical care and housing that non-immigrant and middle-class Americans understand intuitively.

This expansion will serve an additional 30 participants  for 208 new hours of class instruction per student.","To assess the increase in English language proficiency among adults and children, teachers use the English Language Proficiency Assessment (ELPA) rubric. Using a pre-post/post-test design to assess improvements in literacy and language proficiency, teachers first establish students' baseline proficiency in written and spoken English at the beginning of the program and then re-evaluate students at the end. Survey instruments are utilized to assess students' level of acculturation, self-confidence, job preparation, use of English, contact with social institutions, and community engagement. The pre/post-test design will allow staff to identify concerns, needs, and knowledge gained and to determine issues that require assistance for the program going forward. Teachers' observations, students' personal reflections and interviews with family and community members communicate areas to target for intervention, successful areas of growth in students' development, and program achievements.

Expected outcomes:145 served, 20 earning high school diplomas, 20 earning GEDs, and 15-20 students obtaining skills certification in a high demand career field. ","The objective of expanding and updating the Literacy Lab for the Access Center Adult High School Program and GED students is to provide a learning environment conducive to helping students achieve their Adult High School Diploma or GED depending on program. In order to help 20 of the 115 students in Adult High School and 20 of the 30 young adults seeking their GED meet their diploma or GED objective, we need to reshape the lab with equipment that allows for flexibility in the classroom. In other words, by replacing the current 2012 computers with new laptops, the lab will have the flexibility to be used wholly as a classroom for class instruction and tutoring, wholly as a computer lab for online instruction, or a combination of both. Access Center increased enrollment by 56% to 119 students in 2018. The Literacy Lab Expansion/Upgrade Project will also increase the number of computers, accommodating the program growth. ","Access Center Adult High School, a partnership of Goodwill Industries, NWNC and Forsyth Technical Community College increased student enrollment from 76 to 119 in the last year and increased percentage of Adult High School Diplomas received from 53.57% (2017) to 78.57% (2018). The program offers students (18 & older) the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and a career credential in a high demand field such as nursing, medical coding/billing, skilled trades (i.e. welding and HVAC) to increase employment opportunities on graduation. Young adults (16-26) pursuing a GED share the Literacy Lab. Students receive face-to-face instruction, self-paced online classes, computer lab access, guidance & encouragement from a personal career coach, and access to classes to assist with job readiness (resume writing, interviewing techniques, networking, etc.). Forsyth Tech screens candidates; job skills training courses are held at Goodwill. Orientation and assessment ensure students are committed and appropriate for programming. Goodwill and Forsyth Tech underwrite program costs with no charge to participants. Program growth has highlighted the need to increase the number of computers in the Literacy Lab from 10 to 15 to account for larger classes and to update the learning lab, replacing PCs with laptops which are mobile, allowing both classroom and online learning needed to achieve the outcome of receipt of 20 Adult High School Diplomas & 20 GED completions during the grant.","The laptops, laptop charger/storage unit and printer to be purchased through the grant will be ordered as soon as Goodwill receives notification of the grant award. The time from placing the order to installation will be 3-6 weeks (to allow time for getting the computers in, loading with needed software, etc., and installation). Total turnaround time for the project start to finish is estimated at a maximum of 2 months from time of award for project to be complete.

The purchase of 15 laptops with wireless mice and keyboards, a charging/storing cabinet, and an all-in-one printer for student use will provide the necessary technology. By changing to laptops from desk tops, staff and students will be able to use the literacy lab as needed for classroom instruction, online instruction, tutoring, and lab time.

Our program emphasizes personal support and individualized learning to ensure that each student's needs are met. Once they pass their HSE exam, our students go on to better jobs, enhanced career prospects, and further educational opportunities.","The primary objective of our program is to increase the number of adults in our community who have a high school degree or equivalent. Through our program, we expect more than 300 individuals will increase their educational attainment by passing the HiSET exam and receiving their HSE certificate from the state of California.Increasing the number of adults with a high school degree or equivalent also enhances their ability to get higher-paying jobs and to undertake further training or education. Of the students that pass the HSE exam, 93 of these individuals will go from unemployment to a new job, 108 will get an improved job, and 200 will go on to further education.We are particularly dedicated to increasing the number of Spanish-speaking individuals who have an HSE degree in our community. Through our Spanish language HSE Academy in Santa Ana, we will provide HSE courses and personal support to 60 students (primarily parents of children participating in activities at the Boys and Girls Club of Central Orange Coast), and we expect that 27 of them will pass the HSE exam.Finally, we seek to increase the knowledge and confidence of students in our program through sustained progress, which they can see in their weekly practice exams, and the support and encouragement of instructors, mentors, and support coordinators. We expect that 611 individuals enrolled in our program will demonstrate sustained progress in their knowledge and confidence.","Our HSE Academies in Anaheim, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, and Ontario, California provide youth and adults (ages 17 and over) who did not complete high school with free in-class preparation courses in English and Spanish, student support, and the all fees associated with taking the HiSET exam. Our free program is open to all, but we serve primarily low-income students.	HSE Academy courses are provided in-class four days per week and are taught by a live instructor using a set curriculum covering the subjects of the HiSET exam: math, science, social studies, reading, and writing. Student engagement is an important aspect of the success of our program, and our instructors utilize proven teaching methods to engage students in their own learning process. When students are offsite or are ahead of the class on a topic, they use specialized software, Education Essentials, which gives them a personalized study plan based on their progress and allows instructors to monitor student time spent using the software.Additionally, our support coordinators provide cocurricular support to students throughout their attendance at the HSE Academy, offering assistance with any issues that may be impacting students' attendance, academic performance, or personal wellbeing. Tutors are also available to provide mentoring and academic support as needed. Finally, we provide financial support through our free courses and by paying the testing and retesting fees for the HiSET exam for all students.","The HSE Academy is an ongoing program and runs year-round. Students are in-class four days per week for two hours each day and are also provided with a specialized software to enable them to study offsite, which they utilize between 6-10 hours per week.  We enroll new students every two weeks, and they are permitted to stay in the program as long as they need to prepare for the exam, usually between 60-90 days. While we do not limit a student's time within our program, we do monitor their practice exams to ensure that they continue to make progress towards gaining the knowledge and understanding needed to pass the HSE exam.","The most important outcome measure of our program is the number of students who take and pass the full battery of tests for the HiSET exam and receive their HSE Certificate. We track the percentage of our students sitting the exam and their rates of success on all five portions of the exam, and adapt our program year to year to ensure that both of these rates improve. We also monitor student progress through weekly practice tests. These tests show us when a student is ready to take the HiSET exam, alert us to students in need of tutoring, and ensure that students recognize that they are making progress towards their academic goals. Finally, we survey students who have successfully passed the HiSET to ask what they will be doing now that they have their HSE certificate, as well as asking what they liked or what improvements can be made to our program. This feedback has led to improvements such as the addition of Support Coordinators to each ACCEF site, which has in turn led to a notable improvement in student persistence in studying for and, if necessary, retaking the exam until they pass, and the 2019 addition of Mentors to each campus to provide more individual oversight of student progress and academic support as needed. We also use student results and progress to determine topics for professional development at our quarterly staff meetings, and individual staff members seek resources as needed for their students' progress.","HSE Academy receives in-kind support from American Career College in the form of classroom space, signage, computers and other technology, furniture, and office supplies at our locations in Anaheim, Los Angeles and Ontario. We also have a similar agreement with Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Orange Coast to use their classroom space and furniture. This in-kind support allows us to use grants and donations towards the salaries of our instructors and coordinators, as well as the software (Education Essentials) that our students use to study and to take their weekly predictor exams.","At our each location, tablets are available for each student to use during classroom instruction and for students to study/practice out of class.

Students use Education Essentials to study offsite on Fridays, and it also provides flexibility for students who have already passed a portion of the exam to study independently while their class studies the topic they already mastered.  Instructors also have access to each student's Education Essentials records, and can see their progress and total time logged studying offsite.

Language and cultural barriers, among others, prevent many of our students from finding work.   ","According to the Illinois State Board of Education's 2017-2018 Annual Statistical Report, the high school drop-out rate in DuPage County was 0.5% (286 students). The 2017 American Community Survey shows that the high school graduation rate was 92.4%. For low-income students, it was 86.3%. It is important to note that PRC serves many refugees and immigrants who are underrepresented by these measures. This population has generally presented a higher drop-out rate than the County overall. ","According to the 2017 US Census American Community Survey, 165,441 people in DuPage are considered low-income with a household income under $50,200 for a family of 4. 63,806 people live at or below the poverty lineOver the last 20 years, poverty in DuPage County has nearly doubled, with 6.8% living at or below the poverty line. Within the immigrant population, 9.1% struggle with poverty. ","In DuPage County, 7.6% of adults over 25 have not received a high school diploma or have less than a 9th grade education.More than 90,000 residents lack the literacy skills necessary to find work to support their families and to be civically engaged in their communities. Half of the foreign-born population that has not been naturalized report speaking English ""less than well."" Among natives, 1.5% -- or more than 10,500 people -- struggle with English. ",,"During FY19, 150 volunteers will dedicate 11,400 hours of service to support 620 low-income and low-literate adults in achieving their literacy goals, including 60 ABE students, 514 ESL students, and 55 GED and citizenship students. At least 50 ESL students will take the BEST pre-& post-test to measure learning gains, and at least 55% of students will demonstrate at least a half-point learning gain. 130 volunteers will return to tutor or instruct learners.","PRC's Literacy Program seeks to improve the quality of life for DuPage residents for whom limited English language skills or low levels of educational attainment are barriers to self-sufficiency. Each year, approximately 150 volunteer tutors and instructors help learners better communicate in and understand English. Through one-on-one tutoring and group instruction, students will 1) improve their English communication skills; 2) improve their ABE skills; and 3) achieve individual goals such as earning the GED, passing the US citizenship exam, getting a driver's license, and entering training programs or higher education. Trained volunteers work with students one-on-one or in groups on self-identified learning goals. Volunteers receive continued training throughout the year to better understand how to work with ESL and ABE students. Through trainings and access to instructional materials, volunteers will 1) be better able to serve their students; 2) feel supported and valued in their work; and 3) return to tutor and instruct learners.","As a grassroots organization, People's Resource Center programs and services are delivered entirely by volunteers.Volunteers are critical to our Literacy program--without them, it would not exist. Each year, six volunteer trainings are offered for new tutors. They receive packets with more information, tips, best practices and resources to prepare them for their role. Throughout the year, volunteers receive additional training, have access to instructional materials that can enhance their learning and thus the students', and have the support of several program staff. Each year, PRC covers the cost for 6-8 volunteers to attend regional conferences on ABE/ASE and ESL.Our volunteer instructors and tutors work one-on-one and in small group settings to help learners achieve their individual goals, most commonly ESL, ABE, GED and citizenship. They support students hoping to earn a specific licensure or enter a training program. Last year, 150 volunteers supported 640 learners. Currently, open classroom hours are held at PRC's facilities in Wheaton three times per week. Group learning and instruction and one-on-one tutoring occur at partner sites across the county. These additional sites make educational opportunities more accessible to people with transportation barriers. Tutors meet with students at places convenient for the student such as libraries, community centers, churches and apartment building common spaces.","The timeline for accomplishing the annual outcomes stated in this application is Fiscal Year 2019: 7/1/2018 to 6/30/2019. PRC's Literacy program is an ongoing program and will continue with similar projected annual outcomes in Fiscal Year 2020 (7/1/2019 to 6/30/2020).Tutored students typically receive 1-2 hours of weekly instruction. Small group tutoring and conversation classes meet 2-4 hours per week. Instruction occurs either year-round or during the traditional school year.General volunteer orientations occur weekly. Program orientations are held six times each year. Continued trainings are offered quarterly, and a cross-cultural book discussion group meets monthly. They serve as a valuable resource for tutors developing a greater understanding of the cultural, educational and experiential backgrounds of our learners.","Program effectiveness is monitored by the measurable results described above. Utilization of PRC wraparound services and the total number of household members impacted by PRC is tracked in PRC's Client Central Database. Program volunteer hours are logged in a volunteer management database. Client achievements such as earning a GED and gaining citizenship are reported by clients or volunteer tutors and are tracked by program managers.The BEST Plus test is a nationally recognized measurement of speaking and listening skills created by the Center for Applied Linguistics. This computer adaptive test is individually administered by volunteers in a face-to-face oral interview designed to measure English language proficiency of adult learners. The test assesses listening, comprehension, and speaking skills. Post-testing is administered on an as-appropriate basis after students have accumulated a minimum of the recommended 60 hours of instruction. 55% of ESL students who utilize the BEST Plus test are projected to demonstrate at least a half point learning gain.Literacy students also participate in client surveys which provide feedback on progress. Volunteers have their own satisfaction survey.  ","PRC owns two main facilities in Wheaton and Westmont, Illinois where literacy classes and tutoring sessions are held. Should any partner determine it can no longer support the program, PRC is confident in its ability to establish new sites in similar facilities due to a positive reputation in DuPage and the agency's longstanding grassroots community support. MOUs are renewed every three years.","In the Literacy room at PRC in Wheaton, students and instructors can access free Wi-Fi and two desktop computers (one connected to a large screen projector). The PRC-Southeast Literacy room has free Wi-Fi, two computers dedicated to student learning, and a teacher computer connected to a large screen projector. In addition, six laptop computers are available in each literacy classroom.The Literacy program utilizes several software technology programs for instruction and testing: The Interactive Program for the Oxford Picture Dictionary, educational websites (e.g., GED Online), Typing Tutor, and others.When needed, students may also attend basic computer training classes and obtain a free refurbished computer for home use via PRC's Computer Literacy, Training and Access program.

We have also begun a GED program at the Lumpkin County Detention Center. WE have had 5 Graduates from that program and anticipate more this coming year. WE also anticipate more GED students overall this year our goal is 75 graduates this year.,"This program has three outcomes.1. To increase the numbers of GED students and graduates from 55 in 2018 to at least 75 in 2019 in order to promote improved job opportunity and personal growth among the population of Lumpkin County Ga. 2. To provide job counseling to all (100%) of the 2019 GED graduates on an individual basis with a one hour meeting with an appropriate job coach upon completion of the GED. This counseling session will assist graduates in developing a resume; identify jobs for which they might qualify and assistance with interview skills. Our goal would be to place 100% of our graduates in jobs or in continuing education programs for which they qualify.3. For those GED graduates who aspire to continue their education, provide information and counseling from Lanier Technical College and University of North Georgia on specific days during the year Our outcome goal is to get 100% of all student to attend one of these meetings in order to be more aware of their opportunities These meetings will provide information related to programs available to them, costs, scholarship assistance and other information. Each session will include a question and answer period.","The literacy coalition is partnering with 7 community groups in Lumpkin County to coordinate outreach Saturdays in underserved areas to share what resources are available to county residents including free GED classes. We feel certain we can reach our goal of 75 students. Students will also be apprised of our program through Lanier Technical College, the community helping place free clinic, food bank and the chamber of commerce. The most successful method of recruitment for this program is through word of mouth from students who gotten their GED with us. Last year we were awarded the Center of the Year award from Lanier Technical College for our GED program. Our plan is to develop a job counseling program for each graduate in a one on one meeting. A subcommittee with expertise in that area is currently working on developing that program.  We are also partnering with the community helping center to provide clothing appropriate for job interviews. The final outcome for this project is to meet with students who want to continue their education.

Once the placement test is complete students takes approximately 2 months to of GED classes to be ready to take the test. During that two month period each students received approximately 12 hours of instruction in preparation for taking the exam. In the Lumpkin County Detention center remedial work is often required and we anticipate those students needing 3 months of preparation at 12 hours per week. This comes out to about 7500 instructional hours. Lumpkin literacy pays for the pretests and the final GED testing which is 160 dollars per student or $12,000 for 75 students. We provide $10 gas cards when required so that student can get to the center for class. These would amount to approximately $1500 for these 75 students (two gas cards each).

The unemployment rate is in constant flux, and deceptive, as many workers are seasonal employees. With that, a large number of residents who are working are either working part-time jobs or under-employed (low-income services jobs).  ",The majority of NALC student come from Newport and the need is great.  Kentucky has legislation that does not allow high school dropouts under the age of 18.  This makes the dropout rate an unrealistic measure.  First grade has an average of 140 students.  The high school has an average of 89 students in 12th grade.  The graduation rate for Newport High School -- the only public high school serving Newport residents -- has averaged 87% and only 77.5% of Newportians are high school graduates. ,"A staggering 27.8% of the population falls below the poverty level. Of the 27.8% of the population below the poverty level, 91.4% of these families have children younger than 18 years old. Nearly 14% of Newport Independent School students are classified as homeless compared to the statewide statistic of 5%.

There is a waiting list at all times at the detention center for literacy services.  Brigance scores for 17-18, showed 65% are NOT prepared for Kindergarten. 83% of 17-18 Kindergarten students are below average in cognitive/general knowledge.",,"The NALC has an average yearly enrollment of 230 students seeking GED credentials. Students arrive with varying learning levels and skill sets. On average, each year, 28% of NALC students (or 65 students) earn their GED credentials. Grant funds will be used to mitigate financial, transportation and waiting lists, therefore eliminating barriers to success. Expected outcome: an increase graduation rate by 25%.","Objective: If awarded, Dollar General Adult Literacy Grant funds will be utilized raise the GED graduation rate at Newport Adult Learning Center by 25%. *Baseline graduation data was collected over the past three school years (2015-2018). On average, 230 students enroll at the Newport Adult Learning Center each year without high school credentials. Forty-four percent or approximately 103 of those students, arrive with an educational level below 6th grade. Instruction for that cohort of students is focused on providing basic learning skills before enrolling into GED-level classes.  Measurable outcomes: From 2015-2018, 206 students received their GEDs -- an average of 69 graduates per year. The proposed project will target 30 students with significant barriers to educational success, elevating the graduate rate by 25%.","The proposed project will target four barriers that continue to negatively impact GED graduation rates, including students' finances/poverty, transportation, waiting lists and access. The K-12 school district in which NALC is located has free and reduced lunch rate of 91% and the poverty rate is 33.7%. GED examination costs $120 per person or $30 per test section. Many students cannot afford the tests who are test-ready and do not take the final GED exam. Providing GED-testing scholarships would eliminate that financial barrier. After students pass the GED exam, many do not have the finances to pay for a cap & gown to ""walk"" during graduation. In June 2019, only 22 students walked at graduation. Providing free caps and gowns through grant funding would serve to help provide a sense of personal accomplishment, at the same giving students internal incentive to graduate. A 2018 NALC survey found only 21% students have reliable transportation. With a county of 159 square miles in size, lack of transportation can be huge barrier to success. NALC is located on the bus line. TANK, our local public transit provider, has agreed to cut the cost to $10 per book of 10 passes. Finally, there is a waiting list of 60 or more inmates at the local detention center that want to have access to GED/Adult education services.  The current funding is for 28 hours a week.  By adding two hours a week, an additional class could be formed, and 15 more student could be served every week.","Implementation of the proposed project could begin immediately upon receipt of grant funding. The first recipients of the scholarships, for whom finances are barrier, could take the GED exam on Wednesday, May 15th. Scholarships be awarded weekly through April 2020. Graduation is held twice each year. The next graduation is 6/13/19. Caps, gowns and tassels could be ordered upon receipt of grant funds in preparation for graduation. Dollar General grant funding will be utilized to supplement an existing grant. As referenced, the NALC has been operational since 1973. Due to the longevity of the core grant, no additional staff are required to implement the new grant program. Tricia Rohe, the instructor for the detention center, has been on staff since 2001. In that role, she would add two hours per week to her existing schedule to provide could begin those additional class hours immediately upon receipt of the grant award. The project duration will be 45 weeks.  At least 15 different classes are offered each week at the NALC. Classes begin as early as 9 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. to meet the needs of busy working adults. Additionally, there are five hours per week of open lab offered for one on-one help. Most students take two to three lasses per session; classes are typically offered four days a week. This means the targeted students will be in class an average of 12 hours a week at NALC working on GED attainment.","NALC currently uses the TABE test during new-student orientation to asses reading, math and language arts/writing levels. Likewise, the test will be utilized to assess the effectiveness of the proposed project by tracking educational gains. An online, computer based assessment, TABE mimics the GED testing experience, while also providing staff with instant, diagnostic learning profiles for each student -- facilitating faster and more-accurate academic advising. Students will be re-tested following 40 hours of instruction. After students reach an NRS level 5 on the TABE test, they will be encouraged to take the ""GED Ready Test"" in the corresponding subject. Upon successful completion of the GED Ready Test for all subject areas (Reasoning Through Language Arts-RLA; Science; Social Studies; and Math), students will have earned their GED credentials. The main measurement tool that will be used to track the effectiveness of this grant will be the actual number of GED graduates. The case manager for the grant will be keeping detailed records using our KARES on line data system.

TABE is a standardized, diagnostic test developed by McGraw Hill to determine a person's skill levels and aptitudes in reading, mathematics and language. This comprehensive academic assessment tool provides our academic instructors with a reliable and solid foundation for effectively assessing the skills and knowledge of our adult learners who are seeking to improve their literacy skills. Our adult learners complete the TABE at least twice a program year, as a pre- and post-test, to measure their academic progress. The academic instructors use TABE test results to develop and refine an individualized ""course of study"" for each student, based on their reading, mathematics, and language levels. Depending on students' reading, mathematics, and language levels (based on their scores and ability), some must first make progress through Adult Basic Education (ABE) while attending the program to increase academic skills before they are able to work specifically towards completing a GED. Assignments are graded by instructors daily, with progress shared with students. In collaboration with the students, assignments are adjusted and/or modified to keep them moving in the right direction and ensure adequate academic progress.

In 2018 we had 13 classes with 24 volunteer tutors teaching 140 students at our facility and we hope to continue those rates for 2019. With many international companies employing workers from all over the world, ESL classes are increasingly needed. ESL Students gain confidence and language independence so that they can be an active part of their community. ","The objective of the YMCA's English as a Second Language Program is to provide a safe place for non-native speakers to build their English skills. We meet these objectives by enrolling community members into our ESL classes and continually advancing them to higher levels of classes. Our English as a Second Language Program goals are to help students gain confidence in their use of the English language. For many, ordering in a restaurant, navigating the city and taking their children to school can prove to be very daunting when they are not secure in their ability to speak English in public around native English speakers.At the Torrance-South Bay Y, there are currently 13 classes with 24 volunteer tutors teaching more than 140 students. We are decreasing numbers on our long waiting list by improving our tracking system and adding more advanced classes that include organized outings in the community. This grant helps people like, Yinru, who has been in this country for many years living with her daughter and grandchildren.  She spoke no English when she came to us in April 2018 but through Computer Aided Literacy Program and ESL classes she has made great progress. Her daughter says that she is now able to make simple errands on her own, such as going to the market and is more confident in making eye contact and talking with others.  ","The Torrance-South Bay YMCA's English as a Second Language Program runs as a partnership with the South Bay Literacy Council and is a volunteer-led program that focuses on teaching students how to read and converse in English. The program reinforces a steady progress that is conducted two times per week during sessions and emphasizes learning through seeing, hearing, touching and breaking down words into parts.The Torrance-South Bay YMCA works with the South Bay Literacy Council, an accredited English language program organization, for educational materials and outreach for new students. The Torrance-South Bay YMCA is the largest ESL site in the South Bay Literacy Council's network.This program is offered free of charge to all members in the community and we offer free child care at our facility to students who need it. Our students spend three months to a year in our program depending on need. ",Our program is set-up to run throughout the year - January through December - to provide continuity for our students. Students can join classes when space is available or if they need to move up a level.English as a Second Language classes meet at the Torrance-South Bay YMCA Monday through Friday in the morning and evening.We will provide a progress report halfway through the year and again at the end as a way to update the foundation to the programs enrollment and educational status showing how many students have advanced in their learning.,In an effort to have more measurable results we will be implementing a participant survey this year which will be given when they start the program and at the end of the year or the end of their classes. Our goal is that we can use this to track our participant's progress and the effect of our program more accurately. ,"The Torrance-South Bay YMCA provides classroom and small group discussion space for the program. We estimate that the program utilizes 1,900 square feet of space at the Torrance-South Bay YMCA to run the ESL classes each week.

A PGP survey of 155 incarcerated students from six states who were receiving our tutoring services found that: 98% would recommend a PGP tutor to another student. 94% said that a tutor helped them understand their work, and 90% said the tutor helped them achieve their academic goal. The UCLA School of Public Policy determined that $1 million spent on incarceration prevents 350 crimes but $1 million spent on education prevents 600 crimes.","PGP supplements education in jails, prisons, and detention centers by preparing volunteers (primarily university students) to provide free, quality tutoring and related programming to support the academic achievement of incarcerated people. Recruiting events are held on the college campuses at the beginning of each semester as well as coordination with the participating prisons. Each potential volunteer undergoes an intensive selection process to assess temperament, reliability, and maturity. Those chosen then undergo 5 hours of tutor training, cultural training, and additional facilities training before beginning a weekly tutoring session with incarcerated students working toward obtaining their GED. The PGP sponsors all transportation as well as securing facility clearance and coordination. Once they arrive at their assigned prisons, the tutoring sessions, some in groups and some one-to-one, last approximately one to two hours.Throughout the academic semester, volunteers attend mandatory follow-up training and debrief sessions.  ","During the first and last weeks of academic semesters, college students are recruited and training sessions are held. Volunteer applications are accepted throughout the year. State background checks are required and conducted by our facility partners. Once tutors are cleared, the tutoring sessions, some in groups and some one-to-one, last approximately one to two hours. Schedules vary by facility, but generally, tutoring sessions are held three to five days per week in either the morning or afternoon. In 2018, 983 volunteers spent 11,295 hours working closely with 2,500 incarcerated people. In 2019, our goal is to increase to 13,500 hours and 3,500 incarcerated people.

In seven years, our LC has served 700 adults pursuing GEDs, ESL skills, workforce training, and citizenship. In 2011, we had seven tutors and 27 students. We grew to a record 227 students in 2017-18.

In ESL we assess student academic progress using CASAS, Best Plus, and TABE testing.  There are five ESL language skill levels and we test all students semi-annually to track improvement.  For GED students, progress is determined through TABE, GED, and HiSET practice tests and actual GED and HiSET exams.Adults who seek our services establish goals to improve their lives beyond academic achievement.  These goals are vital to our students as success in these areas often underpins improvements in the quality of their lives.  Typical goals are: to get a job, or a better job, to get native country credentials converted to U.S. credentials, to achieve citizenship, to get a driver's license, and to help their children to navigate the challenges of community and school life.

Residents also struggle with underemployment.","The SC Annual School Report Card indicates the following Clarendon County school district's high school drop out rate for 2017-18 as : Clarendon 1 - 0.5%; Clarendon 2 - 2.3%; Clarendon 3 - 2.5%. Two of three districts show an increase in the dropout rate over the last year. However, these rates only reflect those who have attended high school at all. 21% of the population has less than a 9th grade education; this number is 28% when the age group of 17-24 is isolated.","Clarendon County Quickfacts from the US Census Bureau show the 2017 per capita income was $ 20,616 compared to South Carolina of over $26,645.Latest figures from this report show  that 23.2% of Clarendon County citizens live in poverty in comparison to the decreasing South Carolina rate of 15.4%. The median household income is $35,838 whereas the state average is over $48,000. Wages in the area suffer for many reasons, lack of secondary education being a major one.","According to SC DEW, it is estimated that 22.9% of Clarendon County's population lacks basic literacy skills. During the 201-2018 school year, 82% of CCAE students were leveled as Adult Basic Education/ Literacy. 21% of the total population of the 17-24 year old  age group lacked a high a high school credential.",,"We plan to serve 600 individuals. Classroom instruction and online tutorials will be provided to all levels-ABE, ASE, and ESL. Low entry level students will receive instruction in basic Math and Reading. High entry level students will receive targeted instruction for high school units or equivalency testing. Curriculum is based on College and Career Readiness Standards. Expected outcomes will include academic level gains, obtainment of secondary credentials, and NCRC (WIN).","Local and national employers have identified a plethora of desired work ready skills of employees in our area. Among these are Math and Reading skills, Life and Career Success skills, Information and Technology skills, along with critical thinking and collaborative abilities. Each of these are objectives in our project, and also align to WIOA Legislation that requires AE programs to have collaborative partnerships, rigorous curriculum, and career preparedness through a localized Career Pathways approach. Our ""Building Literacy through Career Pathways in Adult Education"" Project is designed fulfill each of these needs and provide literacy services to the citizens in our community. After initial, assessment, teachers review placement levels and design individualized programs of study to help each student master academic skills. During the orientation process, students research a career cluster with which they are compatible, and use that cluster to determine a career pathway. During classes, students attend sessions that emphasize soft skills, digital literacy, and contextualized learning. Specific outcomes:--increase GE/Diploma enrollment from 80 to 95 students.--Increase high school credentials from 25 to 30.--200 of 285 ABE students who score an 8th grade equivalent in reading or math will increase one education level with a measurable gain.--15 of 20 ESL students will increase one educational level.--Increase WIN credentials from 40 to 45. ","Under the supervision of the SC Office of Adult Education, CCAE has the support of Central Carolina Technical College (CTCC), 3 local school districts, and partner agencies. CCAE provides literacy skills upgrade and credential attainment as well as workforce development. Our program will be an integrated process of classroom instruction, career success skills, and transitioning to the workplace. Upon entering CCAE, students are assessed through TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) to measure academic levels in reading, math , and language. Test results are used to design individual programs of study. Instructors diagnose student deficiencies and provide supplementary lessons to remedy those, track student progress, and measure achievement. Students are sometimes grouped by academic levels but all receive individualized instruction programs that address diverse learning styles. Students attend class class and participate in online tutorial programs, such as TABE/GED Academy, SCOIS, and WIN. Aiding students with barriers such as transportation or childcare issues, these web-based programs can be accessed by students off site. Career Pathways are introduced through interest inventories during the orientation process and supported through soft skills workshops, contextualized learning, guest speakers, and group activities. CCAE's transition specialist assists students in career decisions and encourages graduates to seek higher education and employment.

This can be everything from reading their mail to writing a resume. The focus is on each student's individual situation and supporting their unique needs. This means that all instruction is in person and that a higher impact is made with a smaller number of students. For many students, Literacy Connects is an ""on-ramp"" to GEDÂ® preparation or job training programs.","The Adult Basic Literacy program is unique because it is ongoing, allowing students to enroll at any time and begin classes immediately. Measurements of the program are taken quarterly and analyzed for the fiscal year, ending in June. The time line for measurable results anticipated as a result of generous funding from Dollar General is the 2019-2020 fiscal year (July-June).As enrollment is open and ongoing throughout the year, progress assessing happens relative to the student's intake anniversary or relative to the number of instructional hours they have attained. In the fiscal year, students will have had at least four opportunities to demonstrate skill improvement. Up to 24 instructional hours are available to students each week, and students choose the amount of time they are able to spend in classes or with one-to-one tutors, taking into account jobs, families, and other obligations.","Literacy Connects uses GEDÂ® practice tests and Fountas & Pinnell reading levels to track student progress. For students working at or above a sixth grade equivalency, GEDÂ® practice tests are used to measure progress. Often, a student does not take a GEDÂ® practice test until their demonstrated knowledge shows the potential to pass. Therefore, students will have one or two practice test attempts, between six to twelve months after program entry.Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) leveled materials are used for students below a sixth grade equivalency and those who do not speak English fluently. A small group of highly trained individuals administers and analyzes student reading samples. Students are able to show incremental gains, and the assessors discover what the reader knows; the strategies they use while reading; and how well they comprehend the text. The information from the individualized and personal assessment can help tutors target gaps in knowledge and skills directly to see more focused skill growth. Additionally, Literacy Connects has chosen not to assess our lowest level students in TABE because it is now exclusively online, consists primarily of academic language, and takes the student six to eight hours to complete. We have determined that these are intimidating barriers that prevent low level readers and non-fluent English speakers from continuing with their education after the initial assessment.","Literacy Connects purchased a 14,000 square foot facility in 2014 to become a hub for our programs, community outreach, and volunteer training and support activities. There are four classrooms and four meeting rooms for tutors and students to use, as well as a leveled lending library, and extensive free book area. Construction is under way on a 4,000 square foot Youth Center with a staff break room, which will free up space for students to have a lunch room. Currently they have a classroom or outside space to use for their comfort. Priority for room use is given to on-site classes.Each of the classrooms is fully furnished with tables and chairs. Literacy Connects has established a Site Beautification Committee to ensure that rooms are attractive, functional, and inviting, which includes replacing broken furniture, decorating the walls with posters, and ensuring each class has access to storage for personal supplies. It is important that the spaces are not only available areas for students, but that they are inviting and feel like a space students are proud to be in.Literacy Connects' partnership with the Pima County Public Library ensures that our tutors have first access to their meeting rooms and spaces for tutors and students who are meeting off-site. Pairs are encouraged to meet in any public place that is convenient and where they feel comfortable.","Ceiling mounted projectors are available in three of the four classrooms, with a fourth projector on a portable cart. Three of the classrooms have document cameras. Each of the projectors has a connected laptop for ease and versatility of use for the tutors. Students have access to twenty refurbished six-year-old Dell desktops in one of the classrooms, where a drop-in tutoring center is held, and efforts are underway to put five desktops in a second classroom.Although the technology is not state-of-the-art, there are opportunities available to all students. Most students have their own phones, so technology instruction centers around helping students to navigate their own devices. Literacy Connects' subscription to Reading A-Z is available to each of the students via their mobile devices and on the Literacy Connects computers. The facility is equipped with free wifi for all participants to use while they are on-site.",No,,"$227,927.00 ","$227,927.00 ","The primary cost of the program is staff time, or Salaries, for volunteer training, support, and continued education.

Our program will provide instruction for Adult Basic Education (ABE), high school equivalency, and English Language (ESOL) classes. Our goal is to help students improve their basic skills, earn a high school equivalency, transition to higher education, or gain employment.","Our objective is to achieve a measurable skill gain (MSG) in over 800 students out of our total student population in both our career-based high school equivalency classes and ESOL classes. A MSG is defined as a student increasing their educational level across the ABE or ESOL standards, by achieving employment or enrollment in post-secondary education, and/or gaining a high school diploma.","Our population is individuals who lack the skills to become employed or to pursue higher education. A majority of students come from low income, generational poverty status and are often pre-literate or semi-literate. Our goal is to help lift these students out of this background and into a stable career/life path of success. In order to get these students into the classroom we are always challenged in finding ways to market and advertise. We don't want to be a ""best kept secret"" in education. The state of Ohio does not grant marketing funds for programs, but a portion of this grant would be essential in helping to bring students into our classes and increasing the public's awareness of our services.Once the students are in our classes they will receive a classroom experience that is tailored to their unique goals, and skills levels. During orientation week students will compete a career and academic plan which includes a review of their skills and S.M.A.R.T goals. Student will explore possible careers examining the academic requirements needed. Students will work with both teachers and a career coach to develop a detailed educational plan based on their needs and stated goals. Based on this plan, teachers will prepare lessons and provide materials specific to each career cluster. Applied academic, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills are implemented into the curriculum.Both students and teachers will review goals and progress together on a regular basis.","Each class will offer at minimum 5 hours of instruction per week with many classes offering as many as 12 hours of classroom instruction each week. Classes will operate year-round including summer. Each student's length of time in class is determined by their goals and the amount of training needed to achieve them. Statistically, MVCTC Aspire has demonstrated excellent student persistence (average hours of attendance per student) with an persistence score of 67.89 hours from last fiscal year.This was over 7 classroom hours higher than the state average. This score shows that when students take our classes they fully commit and buy into our process.",Our program is both an outcome-based program and a skills-based one. We measure the students skills as they enter the program (pre-test) using the TABE 11/12 test or the Best+ Test. After 40 hours of class for TABE or 60 hours of class for Best+ (the hours recommended by testing guidelines) students are then tested again (post-test). The most up-to-date version of the TABE test: TABE 11/12 will be used to measure our ABE levels of students in our program. For ESOL classes the BEST+ test is used to assess language level. Some ESOL classes may also use the TABE CLAS-E test when needed. Students will be tested according to the parameters set by the testing service.,"The facilities we use vary in location and quality. A majority of our classes take place at local community colleges and resource centers such as Sinclair Community College, Central State University, Ohiomeansjobs Montgomery County/Greene County, and Life Enrichment Centers. Others utilize classroom spaces at local churches such as St. John's UCC, Sulphur Grove, and Abiding Christ Lutheran church. While some locations are given to us, some do require a reasonable amount of rent each year. Classroom supplies are adequate but aging. Some sites struggle with outdated chalkboards and limit use of technology. For example, our current ESOL textbooks are in need of updating to the new WIOA workplace standards for adult education. This would require a potentially substantial capital investment but one that would instantly benefit students and our curriculum to better support the program's goals. Supplies purchased within the first 30 days would include marketing materials, distance ed online curriculum updates, minor facility upgrades, and fundamental technology upgrades such internet access and hardware upgrades.","Technology is an essential part to our classroom and is used frequently when available. The average age of our computers ranges from 2-10 years old and varies in quality. Over 5 of our current class sites do not have adequate internet access. Our current ratio of student to computer is 3:1. Currently our program utilizes a Distance Education model with GED/TABE Academy. This program allows students to work from home (if they choose) to develop their skills while allowing us to track, with great accuracy, the number of hours they have studied. GED/TABE Academy must be purchased every year. In addition, class sites have copy and printing capabilities that have reached the end of their usefulness and/or require maintenance along with the constant use of resources such as ink and paper",Yes,"A portion of the funds from this grant will be used to improve or bring internet access to several classroom sites. Having reliable internet in the classroom opens the doors for students to have access to career resources, job applications, study materials, and official high school diploma practice tests (only available online). Students who are not ""computer literate"" will then have the opportunity to learn skills such as typing, basic computer skills, and safety. Additionally, students often struggle with having access to internet in their homes. We want to allow students to work more effectively from home using our distance education model. As one of our ""stretch goals"" we are looking into ways to allow students to ""check out"" internet hotspots from our local library for home use.","$71,774.00 ","$15,000.00 ","Funds from DGLF will be applied to the follow areas of our educational supplies: Software-$5000, Printing/Publications-$2000, and Computer-$8000. The money dedicated to software will help finance our Distance Education model, GED/TABE Academy, which will allow students to continue to participate in online education from home. DIstance education is a valuable tool for students whose lives don't always align with being in an in-person class all the time. This also compliments our computer funds request for $8000. Five of our class sites are in desperate need of internet upgrades to help bring high-speed internet to the classroom. In addition, these funds will also be used to replace computers that have aged out at various classroom sites. Finally, this computer request could be potentially used to purchase mobile internet hotspots for students to have internet access at home. This will be achieved through working with the local library and ""checked out"" to students who complete a certain amount of hours in-class and at home through distance education. Finally, $2000 will be dedicated to printing/publications through a marketing initiative. In order to fill classes we need to market and connect with the populations we wish to serve.

","According to the Migration Policy Institute, 24% of Brooklyn's population has a limited English proficiency compared to 13% of New York State's population.AAFSC currently does not collect data on literacy rates of our clients, however, the majority of the clients we serve have not attained an education past the middle school level in their home country, and over half are not literate in their native language.",,"AAFSC's free Adult Education and Literacy Program supports immigrant populations as they learn English speaking and literacy skills through ESOL classes, Civics ESL classes, and Citizenship preparation classes. We improved the English of 331 adults in 2018 and are preparing them to obtain gainful employment, citizenship, and confidently engage with their communities and local institutions. With your funding, we aim to have 18 more students receive our intensive education services over one year.","AAFSC's Adult Education and Literacy Program has provided comprehensive, intensive services since 1996. Our free classes work to support immigrant and refugee populations as they learn English speaking and literacy skills, and are open to all in need. The program provides a supportive learning environment for empowerment, social interaction, and self-discovery. Over half of clients in our program are illiterate in their native language but recognize that in New York, they need language and literacy skills to survive. All of our classes are grounded in real life situations to prepare our clients for navigating a new city and unfamiliar systems. By the numbers, your grant would allow us to fund 18 more students for a full year of our intensive Adult Education and Literacy services and advancing their level of English comprehension. Our objective is to prepare students to confidently engage with their communities and local institutions. We aim to work closely with our students to develop their English language skills to prepare them for the workforce, citizenship, and higher education. With funding from Dollar General Foundation, we hope to expand our services by providing more comprehensive support to our growing base of students, purchasing books and learning materials to support our teachers in their curriculum building and instruction, and strengthening our overall programming. ","Staff create and adapt our curriculum collaboratively in response to student needs and demographic changes year to year:1. ESOL 1: An initial literacy course focused on familiarizing individuals with basic English reading, writing, and listening skills. Students are expected to learn the alphabet, typical greetings, and personal identification information. We hold gender-specific classes where necessary to ensure the most comfortable learning environment for all students.2. ESOL 2: This class unleashes our students' potential by creating an environment to discuss feelings and thoughts in English. The class requires students to listen and follow instructions, learn and apply the basic mechanics of writing, interpret ideas and feelings, and comprehend simple sentences.3. ESOL 3: This class is an extension of the skills learned in ESOL 2. Students learn strategies in order to advance their reading, listening, and pronunciation skills. This class requires students to reach and comprehend short story excerpts, follow multistep instructions, produce short sentences, and construct questions.4. Civics ESL and Citizenship: This class fosters clients' social and political integration in their newly adopted home by discussing their role in the larger system of American government and within their local communities. We assist students in studying and preparing for their United States Citizenship exams, covering topics such as American history, institutions, and values.","AAFSC's Adult Education and Literacy program has been in operation since 1996. It runs in four semesters throughout the year: July-September, October-December, January-March, April-June. This funding will allow us to provide services to our students for four semesters.Our weekly instructional hours are as follows: ESOL classes run Monday through Thursday, from 9AM to 1PM in our Brooklyn office for a total of 16 instructional hours per week for each student. Citizenship and Civics ESOL classes run on Fridays from 10AM to 12:30PM in both our Brooklyn and Queens offices for a total of 2.5 instructional hours each.","Our program is largely funded by NYC's Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), through which we implement the Best Plus Test assessments to evaluate the speaking, listening, and comprehension proficiency of our students and report the results to DYCD. DYCD conducted site visits to our center twice in 2018 where they evaluated our overall performance as Above Standard. For each class, we expect our instructors to implement personalized learning plans, in which students will write what they know, what they hope to achieve and, by the end of the semester with their instructor, what they actually have achieved. Instructors will review these plans occasionally to track if students are making progress towards their goals. Each semester, the BEST Plus tests and our internally developed assessments will be administered in order to determine whether or not students are gaining proficiency. The results of these tests will help staff members identify student weaknesses and strengths, and provide insight on different teaching strategies to employ.Our instructors will also assess our students' oral and behavioral changes through classroom observation. Our formative approach entails the instructor using conversation rubrics twice a week to assess students one-on-one on how well they express themselves orally by utilizing learned vocabulary, how they respond to questions and non-verbal cues, and how well they are able to listen and respond. ","Our services are provided at AAFSC's office at 150 Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.

The City of Milwaukee rate, where most of our students live, is 3.7% (US Department of Labor). The unemployment rate of residents who live in lower-socio economic zip codes of the City of Milwaukee is significantly higher. For example, the unemployment rate for zip 53205, where our classes are held, is 21.2% (2017 US Census-American Factfinder).","The Milwaukee Public School district had an enrollment of 76,583 students in 2016/17. According to the 2016/17 Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction data, MPS had a dropout rate of 6.2% which is above the State of Wisconsin goal of under 6%. This represents an average of 4,671 students annually. ","According to the US Census American Fact Finder Data (2017- Poverty rates), 20.5% of Milwaukee County families live on incomes below federal poverty levels. The poverty rate for the City of Milwaukee, where most of our clients live, is significantly higher with 27.4% living on incomes below poverty. In the 53205 zip code where SDC's central services are located, the poverty rate is 44.6%. The City of Milwaukee's poverty rate is one of the highest metropolitan areas in the country. ","According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the percent of Milwaukee County residents lacking basic literacy prose skills is 9%. This is higher than the 7% rate statewide.",," Youth Build is a career-based training program specifically designed for young adults who have dropped out of high school. The challenge for some students is that they lack the basic education they need to successfully enroll in Youth Build. Students must score a minimum level 3 on the TABE test to be eligible. With your support, we will be able to provide Basic Adult Education to 30 motivated students to help them attain basic competencies and reach education and career goals. ",The Adult Basic Education project promotes career pathways as a framework for assisting young adults to successfully transition into the YouthBuild career training program. YouthBuild is a Pre-Apprenticeship Construction training that focuses on young adults who live in Milwaukee's lowest socio-economic zip codes. We are especially interested in supporting young adults who score lower than 3 on the Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE). This is because a score less than 3 on TABE prevents students from enrollment in GED or HSED and therefore not eligible to enroll in YouthBuild.The program includes two core goals and objectives: Goal 1: Provide an environment for adults to be able to demonstrate mastery of knowledge and skills that are equivalent to those attained in a high school program of study.Objective 1-1: At least 40 eligible adult learners (ages 18 and older) receive basic education in mathematics and reading in ABE courses.Objective 1-2: At least 30 adult learners are able to enroll in the GED or HSED program because of successful completion of ABE instruction. Goal 2: Students advance into YouthBuild pre-apprenticeship construction training.Objective 2-1: At least 30 students who complete the education program will participate in career training and will be able to apply education skills while working at a construction or housing rehabilitation site. ,"Adult Basic Education classes are designed to prepare students to gain basic math and language arts competencies.  Once this is achieved, they will be able to move into the GED or High School Equivalency Diploma program which is required for YouthBuild enrollment. For these students, it is a three-phase process: 1) Complete ABE classes and retake the TABE test with the goal of scoring a minimum level 3 (or 5th grade equivalency); 2) Participate in the HSED Competency-Based Diploma (PI-5.09) to earn a high school equivalency diploma, and 3) participate in Pre-apprenticeship Construction Training which combines both classroom and hands-on experiences.The ABE program will be led by qualified teachers who will offer small class instruction, individualized tutoring, and access to computer-based instruction that will help students understand basic competencies. In this course, students will be able to move at their pace and elect to focus on the areas of need as indicated by the TABE test results. ","Over a 12-month funding period Education Services staff will plan and implement 3 cohorts of Youthbuild students. The first cohort is scheduled to begin May 27; the second will begin August 26th, and the third will likely begin January 2, 2020. Youthbuild students start with the completion of academic assessments (TABE testing). Students who score less than 3 on the TABE test will be invited to participate in small group and individualized tutoring to reach basic math and reading/language arts competencies. The timeline for ABE students is dependent on individual progress where some students may be able to gain competencies in one or two sessions, while others need repetitive or more individualized opportunities to reach the minimum scores. Once students meet the required scores, they will advance to HSED. HSED's classroom instruction focuses on the core subjects of Mathematics, Communications, and Pathways. This includes civics, science, health, and social sciences. Students attend classes Monday --Thursday for 3.5 hours a day (70 hours total).  ",Students who enroll in adult education programs participate in both academic and family needs assessments. Students are enrolled in ABE classes based on the results of academic and career assessments. The assessment tool we use is the Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine the level of basic skills. TABE results help the program staff determine if the student should participate in Adult Basic Education courses or enroll in GED preparation courses. The results also allow students to generate an Individual/Career Education Plan (ICEP) and track progress. Students must score at level 3 (Which is equivalent to a 5th grade competency) or more on the TABE test to enroll in GED or HSED. Those who score below 3 will be enrolled in the Adult Basic Education option.  ,"All of our adult education classes take place at a central facility located in the city of Milwaukee. The site is accessible via Milwaukee County transit. It includes classrooms and breakout rooms for instruction, and a computer lab to encourage self-study, practice testing, and tutoring.

Several levels of classes are taught at each center both in the morning and evening (with the exception of the Arlington site, which is from 9-2:30, and the Rondo site, which mostly holds courses in the afternoon and evenings).  Most Open Door Learning Centers offer students between 12-25 hours of direct instruction each week.

","To assess learning gains, students will be given the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) and/or the test of Adult Basic Education (TABE), both state-approved standardized ABE tests.

Distance Learning (DL) is tracked within each DL platform (using built-in hours tracking and assessments).  Staff will run monthly DL proxy hours reports from each platform and enter those hours into the SID database, which is a Minnesota Department of Education-supported ABE tracking system.

Citizenship students will take the citizenship test with a naturalization officer, who will determine whether they pass.  GED students will take tests online through the GED Testing Service and receive their scores electronically.

The collective average of these four branches is 8.05% which is significantly higher than the unemployment rate for Orange County and Florida.  ","The Florida Department of Education reported the dropout rates for Orange County schools from 2011-2016, showing a substantial decrease in recent years.  In the 2011-12 school year, the dropout rate for the county was 3.5% and dropped to 3.1% the following school year.   The 2013-2014 year showed a slight decrease with a 3.2% rate.  2014-2015 showed an improvement again with a rate of 1.9%.

This is the same for the state of Florida.,,"The goal of the Orange County Library System's (OCLS) ""English From Zero"" program is to enhance the English language skills of at least 3000 people living in the Orange County area.  The program is designed to provide individuals with essential vocabulary and sentence structures skills to develop the language proficiency needed to have everyday conversations and to increase their employability.  ""English From Zero"" will be taught by two certified, experienced ESOL instructors.","Providing weekly ESL classes in these needy areas of Orange County will help non English speakers learn the language as well as the culture, making it easier for them to assimilate in the community and find employment. Although some of the recent Puerto Rican arrivals have basic knowledge of English, the vast number of them do not speak English and lack the necessary basic language proficiency needed to obtain employment.This program helps provide individuals with essential vocabulary and sentence structures to develop the language proficiency needed to have everyday conversations.The objectives:1. By the end of June 2020, 3000 students will demonstrate improvement in their English language skills as shown by assessment resources of the ""Side By Side Plus"" curriculum. This curriculum provides placement, unit, mid-level and final exams. This curriculum is a standards-based series aligned with major adult education curriculum that prepares students for their roles in the community, school and work.  Students will be tested in June, November and April to determine their success in language proficiency.  The outcome is for participants to progress to the next level of the ""Side By Side Plus"" curriculum as measured by the proficiency tests.2. 3000 students will complete speaking, writing and vocabulary assignments in portfolios in June, November and April. 3. By the end of June 2020, an average of 15 students per ""English From Zero"" class per branch will participate.  ","""English From Zero"" is a grant funded class currently taught at 4 library branches. OCLS was awarded  $10,000 in July 2017 by DGLF and hired 2 ESL instructors; an additional $10,000 was awarded by DGLF to continue the program through April 2019. Classes are structured with ""I do, We do, You do"" exercises based on Florida English Language Learning Standards using real life scenarios and vocabulary. The funding for the current classes runs out at the end of April 2019. The $15,000 requested would fund the program through June 2020.  The 4 branches selected serve a large population of non-English speakers, who are not only new to the area, but new to the United States.  The 4 branch average of non-English speakers is 37.22%, which is significantly higher than the state estimate of 28.3%. In Orange County, the number of people who speak English less than ""very well"" is 36.7%.  Comparatively, North Orange has 44.5% of its population estimated to speak English less than ""very well."" Washington Park averages 37.4%, while Hiawassee averages 39.9%. South Trail has the most people who speak English less than ""very well"" at 45.8%. The 4 branches selected for this grant have an average foreign born population of 24.5%. Providing weekly ESL classes in these needy areas of Orange County will help non-English speakers learn the language, the culture and make it easier for them to assimilate in the community as well as find employment and start to build ties to their community.    ","The timeline for this project will begin May 2019 after the current funding for ""English From Zero"" runs out.  With continued funding from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, ""English From Zero"" will run through June 2020, adding approximately 224 additional ESL classes to OCLS' offering.  Two part time casual ESL trainers will work in three hour blocks of time.  Each trainer will teach at two locations once a week, allowing for four ESL classes per week from the grant money.

Mid-level exams will be administered in November and a final exam will be given in April to determine success in student performance and document student progress and achievement. Portfolio writing assignments and surveys would be administered in June, November and April. The portfolios would be used to measure the participants' ability to write in English.  Participants would be assessed on their ability to complete specific tasks, write simple sentence, and communicate basic information. Instructors would track the improvement of each participant. A successful portfolio would demonstrate progression in language in the form of fewer mistakes in speech and writing.  Instructors would have students take a survey asking their employment status. If employed, they would be asked if they have received a promotion recently.  These results would be tabulated by the instructors.  Success stories would be collected and documented to be shared with the community. As part of the Library's strategic plan to increase awareness of OCLS and what is offered, we will explore ways to include testimonials, kudos and comments in OCLS marketing collateral.

Beneficiaries of the project may also claim up to two additional vouchers for retests.  Because of the GEDÂ® for Life project, it is an anticipated that 75% (94) of the project participants will obtain the GEDÂ® diploma.","The goal of the GEDÂ® for Life project is to provide vouchers (scholarships) to approximately 125 students to cover the cost of the four test modules that make up the GEDÂ® test.  Of these students, 75% (94 students) will pass all four modules to achieve their GEDÂ® diploma.Given the region's poverty level, many adult GEDÂ® seekers have difficulty affording the $120 fee required to take the GEDÂ® test.  A small number of partners provide vouchers for some or all of the cost of completing the GEDÂ® test.  However, student access to the partner resources is often limited by a complex array of guidelines and eligibility requirements.  As a result, many Big Sandy SKILLS U students are not able to utilize these niche funds to pay for GEDÂ® test expenses.

Test vouchers will be awarded to students on a first-come/first-serve basis as they become eligible based on readiness testing and determination of funding sources.  When a student obtains a score of 145+ on a GEDÂ® Ready test in any one of the four subject areas, he/she meets the readiness-testing standard to take the GEDÂ® test.  Big Sandy SKILLS U staff will work with each student to ascertain if he or she is eligible for external programs that provide vouchers for GEDÂ® testing.  GEDÂ® for Life vouchers will be utilized to cover the cost of testing for a student who will otherwise not have the means to pay for the test or retests if applicable.","Big Sandy SKILLS U centers will implement the GEDÂ® for Life program to provide test vouchers to eligible students from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020.

In an eight-week period, we expect our students to attend at least 48 hours. The lowest-level readers are strongly urged to attend 54 hours per session. In each session, 144 classroom hours are available. YES! students have the flexibility to decide which days to attend.Many of our students will need to be with us for at least a year to make significant progress so we do not limit the duration a student can stay, as long as they are attending the minimum number of required hours.Digital literacy classes and one-on-one computer skills tutoring are available for 10 hours per week at our Algiers site. Students are admitted on a rolling basis as space allows. The 6-week, group computer class covers basic computer skills including email, browsers and internet searches, basic social media, photo attachments, and Microsoft Office.","Success is measured by pre-and post-testing using the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine the students' reading and math levels. Gains are measured after 40 hours of class instruction. This is used to determine when students are ready for HiSET testing or transfer to workforce training programs.As a recipient of State and Federal funding through the Louisiana Community and Technical Colleges System, YES! must uphold the standards of Louisiana Department of Adult Education. Continuation of funding is contingent on the following criteria, based on best practices: a) Meaningful student progress is measured regularly by the standardized Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE); b) All teaching/sites supervised by highly-qualified professionals; c) Student data submitted on a timely basis for ongoing monitoring by the Department of Adult Education; d) Programs are located in or near areas of profound economic need.YES! receives constant monitoring of student data and their academic progress from the staff of Work Ready U., the adult education department of the Louisiana Community and Technical Colleges System (LCTCS). YES! is required to submit its students' information regarding employment and specialized test performance to the Louisiana Community and Technical Colleges System on a quarterly basis. ","All program facilities are donated to the YMCA by New Orleans Public Library (NOPL) thanks to an agreement reached by the two entities in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We have successfully maintained this relationship for over a decade and do not foresee it changing in the near future. NOPL contributes classroom space, security, parking, telephone, and IT support. The YMCA is responsible for providing all staff, teaching materials, testing forms, computer hardware, printing, and office supplies.","Given that YES! focuses on lower-level adult learners, many of whom have trouble decoding even simple words, it is no surprise that few YES! students are familiar with computers and basic keyboarding skills. Further, the relative poverty of YES! students keeps many of them from enjoying access to computers in their own homes. However, today technology skills and digital fluency are pre-requisites for jobs of the new economy. It is almost non-negotiable that individuals know how to use a computer so that they can apply for employment, move into better-paying jobs, or simply to search for information.With this in mind, YES! requires all clients, from non-readers to advanced students, to use computers to reinforce their studies as a way to gain basic digital literacy and computer skills. During direct instruction, students work at individual computer workstations with assistance provided by the teacher and volunteers. Currently, YES! has a total of 20 desktop computers, ten tablets, eight laptops, and access to IXL.com, a subscription-only online reading and math tutorial. This allows our students to work at home on their computers or phones while allowing our teachers to track their progress.",Yes,"We are requesting funding to help us purchase student seats on IXL.com. This is an online skill-building platform that allows our teachers to make assignments and monitor student usage. While we have tried other programs, IXL.com is best suited for our program's needs. This online utility allows our teachers to monitor student usage and gives us the ability to then generate reports on that usage as well as student progress. The program also provides instruction appropriate for our lower-literate participants. Additionally, our students enjoy the added flexibility the program gives them. Because it is an online resource, students can access the program outside of class times through the computer lab or on personal computers if they have them. IXL.com has not only helped to reinforce math and reading skills, but it is also giving our students a way to practice mouse and typing skills. As we move to all-digital HiSET testing, YES! is aware of the need to incorporate more opportunities for our students to become comfortable with computer usage. Finally, we believe that these computer skills will only make it easier for students to thrive in the workforce.","$305,500.00 ","$249,917.14 ","$5000 - toward the total $23,400 cost of our part-time Data Manager.

We have used grant funding in the past to pay the cost of hiring a contract instructor, a retired public school educator who is both fluent in English and in Spanish and is experienced in working with adult learners.  Our contract instructor has a set course curriculum for this introductory program, which begins with the alphabet and common pronunciation sounds and progresses to vocabulary development, grammar, and basic sentence structure, beyond which we believe our adult learners are then capable of joining our intermediate ESL classes. A library staff member teaches these intermediate classes and tailors the classroom curriculum around adult learners' abilities and needs. Our objectives are to help adult learners become more fluent in English and to help them advance to our intermediate ESL classes in order to continue with their ESL learning. ","Our introductory ESL program will include 24 weeks of instruction, eight weeks for each of our proposed ESL courses. Our classes will be held twice weekly, for a total instructional time of three hours per week and 24 hours of instructional time per course.

In total, our program will comprise 48 class sessions over three courses and 72 instructional hours in total. ","Our library branch uses Project Outcome as its primary assessment tool. Project Outcome is a survey and data analysis tool developed by the Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association. The goal of Project Outcome is to help public libraries like ours understand and share the impact of library programs and services, such as our library branch's ESL program. We will utilize Project Outcome's immediate and follow-up survey tools to gauge learners' progress both during their introduction to our ESL courses and again towards the end of our ESL courses. Project Outcome will not only help us to gauge our adult learners' assessment of their own progress, but will also help us to collect insights on the success of our program and ways that we can better it.

The pre and post-assessments measure proficiency and competency in all four-skill areas, which are reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Additionally, SPL will track the following objectives: * Increase attendance for the ESL program by 5 new students. * Increase in student Best Plus scores in Reading and Writing by 3 to 4 points. * Retain 7 ESL students. This means 7 of the same students attend an ESL class regularly. ","SPL expanded its existing ESL program by introducing a new class for more advanced learners. SPL now offers an intermediate class on Wednesday's from 9:30 AM -- 10:30 AM, concurrently with the beginner ESL class. The intermediate class provides further instruction for students who have higher levels of proficiency and would benefit from more challenging material. In order to retain students, SPL now offers 3 different classes; beginners, intermediate, and a conversational ESL group. Existing students from the first year of the program have progressed steadily through the curriculum and new students have been joining the class with varying levels of proficiency. The intermediate ESL class and the conversation group have proven to be great entry points for students in search of ESL support. SPL intends to be responsive to community needs and proposes the following ESL classes and support for ESL students for the second year of the program: * A new intermediate ESL class for more advanced ESL students (weekly). * Weekly ESL beginner's class (Basics and Beyond). * Continue bi-weekly conversation group.* Launch pop-up library services (2x a month) at College and Career Academy at Pruden during their evening ESL classes and Adult Ed Programs.  * Continue partnership with Suffolk Literacy Council (SLC) to provide one-on-one tutoring support for ESL students. * SPL staff members trained by SLC to become conversational coaches, ESL tutors, and employment mentors.","The second year of ESL classes will take place from May 2019 -May 2020.

SLC has one trained test administrator on staff. Pre-Post Assessment: SPL will provide all students, at the start of the program, with a pre-assessment of their reading, writing, listening, and speaking abilities. At the end of the program, a post-assessment will be conducted. In doing so, SPL can formally track how much progress the students made in a year.

The library is also a child-friendly environment, which helps build community among the ESL students and offers a safe place to practice and learn. Thirteen out of the 17 ESL students are mothers who bring or have brought their kids along with them to class. SPL has become a place for parent-friendly learning at no cost. Students have been highly appreciative of the child programming services SPL has provided. Often during the ESL classes, there are children's programs occurring so parents attending the ESL classes can feel comfortable allowing their kids to attend the programs while they attend the ESL class.  ","The North Suffolk Library currently has 5 dedicated laptops for the ESL classes (about one-year-old). ESL students are able to check out a laptop to use during class and take home with them for further use.  There are also 5 public PC's for patron use and are available free of charge. These PC's are about 3 years old and available for all public use. The PC's are not used during ESL instruction.

The program will also enhance basic life skills and improve the lives of those struggling with literacy issues.  The goal is set at serving 200 clients each year and providing them with learning sessions. By obtaining a grant, EOH will be able to increase the number of literacy sessions. The new program will expanded by approximately 40-50 sessions for each student. Promoting the literacy program will extend throughout the homeless community.  ","The program will offer sessions to cover grammar, punctuation, phrasal verbs, vocabulary, spelling and use of idioms. It will also explain ways of utilizing the library and the various resources.  In order to meets the needs of each homeless student, our tutors will use several formats of lessons to find the best way each individual student learns. Research shows adults learn best when they know the specific, practical reason or purpose for what they are being asked to learn. They desire to use previous experiences as a relevant and supportive foundation for new learning and understanding the relevance to their job, life, family, country or values. This allows them to actively learn using problem based or activity based learning rather than memorization. They will be able to use internal motivation to learn rather than an external teacher based motivation."" (Stern, 2010, p.73) We think most of the homeless adults that take part in our program will be doing so because they want to better themselves and enhance their lives.

It is a combination of traditional classroom instruction and many interactive sessions utilizing various technology-oriented resources. The learners will learn and improve their English proficiency and US civic and culture to become self-sufficient and contributing members of communities where they live.","CC ESL has an objective of teaching non-English speaking immigrants to be self-sufficient in the society where they belong to, meaning they will be properly prepared with reasonable levels of English proficiency and cultural understanding, so that they will become employable as well as actively participating in and around activities in the community and the society. To achieve this objective effectively, CCI uses BEST Literacy by the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) to monitor the participants' improvements and progress in learning. BEST Literacy is a print-based, combined test of reading and writing skills. The test uses authentic situations specifically geared for adult English language learners in the United States as the basis for test questions. BEST Literacy is aligned with the ESL descriptors of the National Reporting System and the Student Performance levels. It will enable the instructor to gauge participants' reading and writing skills. Also, regular face-to-face, interview type assessments will be provided and recorded, so that both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the participants will ensure that participants are learning and improving according to the assessed level.","CC ESL is composed of textbook based instruction, helping learners with language foundation in vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure; also interactive conversational components to practice actual language usage in various situations and subjects. Cultural/historical elements of the United States will be also offered to the learners regularly as parts of the entire curriculum for them to be properly equipped to be successful members of the society beyond being fluent speakers of English. By setting up the virtual target to take the US Citizenship test, key historical facts and various civics topics and subjects will be taught and discussed; role playing and dialogue activities will be offered regularly. After all, the learners will be self-sufficient and capable not only in linguistic skills but also in socio-cultural aptitude. The class levels are structured as follows:Beginning: Students cannot speak, understand English or understands only isolated words or phrases.Low beginning: Students have very limited English proficiency and are just grasping the familiar lexicon of English.High beginning: Students are taught all the parameters of English grammar/conversation.Low intermediate: Students continue to build on the early learning skills attained in the previous level classes.High intermediate: Students focus on developing more complex speech with varying levels of grammar/vocabulary.Advanced: Strong conversational skills to a variety of real-life topics.","The fiscal year will be divided into 4 segments as in quarters; each quarter will last a minimum of 10 weeks, and there will be two two-hour sessions in a week. Therefore, the learners will have a minimum of 40 hours of direct learning opportunity in class per quarter. In this timeline, the learners will be able to advance to the next upper level of language skills and proficiency in two quarters when they attend classes regularly and with necessary practice of learned skills.","CC ESL is to take BEST Literacy to evaluate the participants' performances throughout the program. Designed specifically for adult learners of English, performances on BEST Literacy can be interpreted in terms of the National Reporting System (NRS), ESL educational functioning level descriptors or the Student Performance Level (SPL) descriptors, from levels 0 up to 8, or 6 levels in NRS levels. Also, CC ESL will use TOEFL PrimaryÂ® Speaking Test level proficiency descriptors, which have 6 different levels from 0 to 5. As a placement test at registration, both BEST Literacy and oral test will be provided to each participant, and the combined scores of these tests will be recorded for each participant; later at the end of two consecutive quarters, the same tests in different versions will be offered to see their changes in performance and to be recorded. CC ESL maintains highly detailed records to effectively assess and measure the progress of students. CC ESL has begun and continues to conduct pre-program and post-program interviews to assess individual student goals. As each student completes their levels and progresses through the program, staff can then further conduct post-program interviews to ascertain whether or not the student was able to meet their specific goals in English Literacy skills. All of these assessment techniques serve to strengthen our commitment to providing accountability in this English Literacy program.","Currently there are 4 different locations for CC ESL program in the target geographical area, and all locations are fully equipped with tables, chairs, whiteboards, big screen TVs for audio, video, and computer connections, and all other necessary amenities to serve the participants without any issue or problem.

This laptop computer is connected to a 30"" LCD TV or a conventioal projector to present classroom materials, such as textbooks, activities, audio and videos clips. Because the size of the TV is too small, the plan to have bigger size TVs in class for the better legibility is discussed and considered. Moreover, the internet is a must-have classroom technology to enhance the quality of both teaching and learning experiences.

Increasing enrollment of students and tutors via a more aggressive radio advertising campaign. 3 Expand the LVW library to provide pairs of books to study teams as needed or requested. Our population varies over time, we currently serve 10 families & 37 adult students and hope to increase both numbers by 10-15%. ","The need for literacy services in Central Maine is great. Up to 13% of Kennebec County adults lack basic prose literacy skills, which means they cannot fill out a basic job employment form, read instructions onprescription medications, or read a book to a child. 8% of adults in Kennebec County never finish high school and/or receive a GED (2011 American Community Survey, US Census Bureau). Lack of literacy skills is a tragic circumstance for young families whose children are more likely to grow up with insufficient reading skills, thereby perpetuating the cycle of illiteracy. We are the only free adult literacy organization in the Waterville Area to address these needs. While we have experienced success,  building awareness of our services needs emphasis, our library needs expanding and more importantly the LVW office needs to be more available to our stakeholders for more hours of direct, effective service. We have seen by adding an extra 4 hours to our sole part-time employee's schedule vastly improves service to our tutors & students by being present and responsive to walk-ins and calls. (Data available) Funding ended our ability to continue. The Future & Expansion Project would support that expansion and more, while we continue to provide: 1. tutoring & ongoing tutor training, 2. connect with  partner agencies to build awareness & work collaboratively to address the root causes of illiteracy & 3.

","The LVW Future and Expansion Project highlights the objectives needed to sustain our local program beyond the daily activities, while expanding our services. For 44 years Literacy Volunteers Waterville Area has been a non-profit 99% volunteer organization with one part time office coordinator. Board members volunteer time and effort to maintain the office and its organizational needs, provide professional development & tutor training, arrange and participate in community outreach events as well as build awareness of our services. LVW is the only free, confidential, and uniquely, one-to-one literacy program available. We teach adults and their families to read. Our students, with tutor support, set and reach goals to enhancetheir lives. (eg: get a driver's license, relearn to read after a stroke, achieve a GED, read to children/grandchildren, help with homework, read aloud as a family) Four programs help to fulfill this goal:1) Basic1-to-1 Program2) Team Teaching with Fairfield & Waterville Adult Ed3) ESL - English as a second language4) Family Literacy:Teaching families to read together by helping the adult (parent) understand and develop reading skills,and connect with local libraries for free resources.We have been successful. This Project will ensure LVW's future while expanding our services by:1. Expanding office hours 2. Providing radio announcements, to those who need  & are unable to read, about our services. 3. Expand LVW's lending library"," During summer months our office coordinator will work the usual 2, 4 hour days. LVW data shows that traffic through the office and phone calls are much slower during this time period. We will then add an extra 4-hour day in fall, winter, and spring which will allow us to meet the varied needs of students, tutors and board members to provide intake, materials, a problem solving format, let alone gathering data for our grants, reports and donors. We will also begin radio advertising in late April/May for (hopefully) 3 months. This is especially helpful in recruiting Family Literacy students who are not completing their course work, are failing, or falling behind due to literacy issues. This is also the best time frame for recruiting new tutors, as our main tutor training session occurs in September. As money becomes available, we are planning to upgrade our library. With this expansion of time we will:1) run advertising on the 2 major stations ($1,400/month with extra ad time as well as the AM Countrystation are generously added at no charge.)2) be able to add tutor and student requested literature to enhance and update our lending library (whichpresently includes multi-sensory reading material and carefully selected Literature).3) and most importantly provide more time and energy to all our present and potential stake holders 'toteach adults and their families to read.'","Our ultimate goal is student literacy improvement. We use the Bader Reading Inventory to assess the individual strengths and weaknesses of each student, enabling us to create explicit and direct instructional lessons to meet each individual need. Students determine their goals with tutor input and lessons are student centered. Tutor/Board conversations determine additional student needs, progress, and goals met. These conversations often provide the sometimes indiscernible growth that more standardized assessments miss. All assessment data is gathered to determine student progress. Educational data as well as the Future and Expansion Project outcomes presented in this proposal will be compared to previous year's data to determine success.

","The NWCC Adult Education program is designed to help adults strengthen literacy, problem-solving, numeracy, and employability skills in order for them to attain a high school equivalency diploma. After receiving the high school equivalency diploma, the adult learner will be assisted with a transition into post-secondary classes, the workforce, or the military.  The environment in the classes offered is designed to give special attention to adults returning to school to resume educational programs which were interrupted in earlier years. Learning conducive classroom settings are where the project is implemented. A diagnostic TABE assessment is given to each student upon entrance to the program.  This assessment helps instructors identify the strengths and weaknesses of the student.  This information is used to establish a learning plan for the student.  Instructors use lecture, group work, individual tutoring, online programs, and independent study to ensure that students are progressing in their educational levels. Volunteer tutors are also available to the learners. After 40 hours of classroom instruction students are given a TABE post assessment to determine progress. All documentation of student data and progress is recorded in LACES data base system.  Instructors use this data system to record attendance also. The teachers monitor this data daily.

Of those that were released and re-arrested for a subsequent crime, 57% were unemployed at the time of that arrest. The unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated people is over 5 times that of the general U.S. population. Over 60% of inmates in this country are functionally illiterate, which by definition means that they ""lack the literacy necessary for coping with most jobs.""","Based upon the most recent prison data, 40% of inmates in the U.S. are without a high school diploma or GED. This compares to 7% in the general population. Most are functionally illiterate, and do not have access to formal education while incarcerated. Prior to being given one of our books, many had never in their lives read an entire book cover to cover. ","Incarcerated people had an income that was 41% lower than non-incarcerated people at the time of their arrest. The poor are statistically much more likely to be incarcerated, and more likely to be re-arrested when released.  There is a relationship between income level and reading. We provide quality books to an audience that has no other way to get them. Prisoners have plenty of idle time to read, and can benefit more from reading than perhaps any other segment of the population.","Sixty percent of all prison inmates are functionally illiterate, compared to 14% of the general population. Most can read, but do so at elementary levels. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ""The link between academic failure and delinquency, violence, and crime is welded to reading failure.""

Meeting this goal will get our books into the hands of over 164,000 incarcerated men and women (some readers receive more than one of our four titles). Our 2019 goal represents a 23% increase in books gifted versus 2018. In 2018, World Book Bank was able to gift 146,537 books to people in 564 facilities. Our focus in 2019 has shifted towards being able to positively affect more lives by sending fewer books per shipment to more facilities, and by increasing group reading participation. We measure group participation through surveys emailed to our contacts at the facilities. Historically 41% of jails and prisons we've served have implemented formal reading/discussion groups utilizing our books. These groups are facilitated by either local staff or local outside volunteers.

We track our performance versus our weekly and monthly targets. In January of 2019, we gifted 15,194 books to people in 93 jails and prisons across the country.We have contracts in place that will allow us to keep our cost per book at or below $1.73 for 2019 without service interruptions. Our facilities are owned by our founder. We have no debt.We are selective about the types of organizations that receive our books. We want to make sure that the books are freely available to potential readers. We seek out new facilities that will not only freely distribute our books, but will also incorporate them into formal reading/discussion groups.Our leadership is firmly committed to helping as many people as possible with the funding we receive. Our success is not tied to more capital, technology, or staffing. We are equipped to be able to gift one book for every $1.73 in funding received in 2019.    ","World Book Bank plans to distribute 180,000 books to 1,000 jails and prisons in 2019. We plan to raise $311,196 in order to do this. Our plan for books gifted is consistent from month to month throughout the year -- 15,000 books to 84 facilities. We will adjust these numbers up or down based upon funding received throughout the year.Our goal is to have at least 500 of the organizations that we serve offering formal classes and groups based around our literature. The size of the classes varies widely between facilities. Some ""Purpose Driven Life"" classes have up to 80 participants, while others have as few as 9. ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" groups in jails and prisons average 12 participants.Classes are typically one hour in duration and held weekly. Some of the 500 facilities will offer more than one class using our literature. At an average class size of 15 participants, meeting our 2019 goal will result in 429,000 classroom hours utilizing the books that we donate. ","World Book Bank does not currently have the means to measure or track educational gains made by individual readers of our books in correctional facilities. Our books are intended to provide people who are in a miserable and desperate situation with hope that there is a way out. Our program is made available to people who are otherwise forgotten by society. Quality books are few and far between in jails and prisons, and over 60% of this segment of the population is functionally illiterate.  Our books get people reading who have read very few, if any, books in the past. The specific titles that we have selected provide the spark for many to begin an entirely new way of life. Our books encourage people to read more books. We measure the number of books that we gift, the number of organizations we serve, and have begun measuring the number of organizations that are utilizing our free literature as the basis of classes and groups. The difference our books are making can best be assessed by reading some of the thousands of letters we've received from our readers.

Additionally, Census data shows that 47.9% of foreign-born, non-citizen residents of Portland, Maine report that they speak English ""less than very well."" ",,"In the 19-20 school year, EL+LP will improve 150 no- to moderate-income adults' English language proficiency through classroom instruction and/or 1-on-1 tutoring.At least 40 tested students will show improvement in their oral language proficiency as measured by the Student Oral Language Observation Matrix.At least 70 students who are matched with a tutor will use an Individual Service Plan model to identify, track and achieve specific language outcomes. This will vary for each student.","EL+LP students are adult immigrants, refugees and asylum speakers whose primary language is not English. The program will be equipped to meet the needs of students ranging from pre-literate learners to those who are highly literate in their first language.The program's objectives are 1) to improve at least 40 class attendees' oral language proficiency in the areas of pronunciation, vocabulary, fluency, grammar and/or comprehension as outlined in the Student Oral Language Observation Matrix, an assessment administered by classroom teachers, and 2) to improve at least 70 student tutees' skills in basic literacy and/or speaking, reading, writing, job readiness or test preparation as determined and measured by each student's Individual Service Plan which is developed by their tutor. Classroom objectives will be met over 2 semesters that follow a traditional academic school year. Tutees' objectives will be met over a 6-month tutoring period. LearningWorks is uniquely positioned to serve a wide spectrum of students, ensuring that the program is not ""one-size-fits-all"" but rather, meets each student at their individual starting points and tailors objectives accordingly.What sets E+LP apart from other service providers in the area is the personalized nature of instruction. Small group classes foster students' confidence and sense of belonging, while other students report that they enjoy the sense of personal guidance and positivity their tutors bring to lessons.","1. Classes: EL+LP's classroom instruction follows a progression of ""life skills"" topics that were selected based on student and volunteer teacher feedback. Course materials are diverse, ranging from traditional grammar textbooks and picture dictionaries to conversational role-play series and employment readiness materials. Teachers supplement instruction with creative approaches to collaborative language learning. Curriculum topics currently include job seeking, health, food and shopping, and emergency readiness. To expand on students' understanding of key concepts and broaden their view of available resources, guest speakers from local organizations give presentations in classes. Additionally, field trips, social events and classroom potlucks increase students' sense of community engagement while building cultural comfort and conversational fluency.  2. Tutoring:  Because EL+LP students come from a variety of educational backgrounds, they must be given the opportunity to learn course material at their own pace in a way that is relevant to their individual goals. All students in the tutoring program receive 1-on-1 support from trained tutors who are coached to 1) break down the student's broad goals into achievable sub-goals using a strengths-based service plan model; 2) assess the student's academic strengths and weaknesses so as to strategically tailor lessons; and 3) create a safe and welcoming learning environment to ease learners' anxiety.","The classroom schedule of EL+LP corresponds with the academic school year. Classes will take place from September 2019 to May 2020 with a potential summer semester option following the end of classes in May (dependent on volunteer teacher availability). In this schedule, students attend classes twice a week in 2- to 3-hour sessions. Tutoring is offered year-round; students who are matched with a tutor meet weekly for a minimum of 6 months for 1.5 to 3 hours per week. After 1 year, students will have received approximately 230 hours of classroom instruction and/or 80 hours of tutoring. As of the date of this application, there are 40 students enrolled in classes and 60 active tutoring pairs. By FY20, we anticipate that we will engage at least 75 tutors and enroll at  least 50 students in classes. During this timeline, students' progress is marked not only in terms of increased language proficiency, but also in personal and emotional growth. Students give us continuous, informal and impromptu feedback about their sense of accomplishment over the course of a class or tutoring period. One student who was enrolled in our beginning-level conversation class was describing his shyness and sense of isolation at the beginning of the semester. Speaking specifically about his classroom teacher's guidance, he said of his time in the program, ""Now I can talk to people--because of Susan."" ","1. Classroom assessments: Classroom teachers and assistant teachers will administer the SOLOM at the beginning of a student's participation in the English classes and once again at the conclusion of the course. The SOLOM is a nationally recognized rating scale developed by the San Jose Area Bilingual Consortium and the Bilingual Education Office of the California Department of Education. Teachers use the SOLOM to assess students' command of oral language on the basis of what they observe continually in a variety of situations. Utilizing evidence from classroom interactions among students and teachers, instructors match a student's language performance in five main categories to descriptions on a five-point scale for each. The scores for individual domains can be considered, or can be combined into a total score ranging from 5-25 points.2. Tutoring assessments: The dual use of the ""SMART"" goal framework and the strengths-based ISP (a tool adapted from best client relationship practices in both social service and education) enables tutors to identify and track educational gains specific to each student. The ISP model we use includes the following elements: a long-term goal or need; a ""SMART"" objective(s) that can be achieved along the way; measurement strategies; action steps and dates of completion.

Program administrators are currently conducting research to determine the most appropriate and cost-efficient database software options available to help achieve these long-term sustainability goals.Purchase of database software will allow us to streamline and organize record-keeping, thereby sustaining and expanding volunteer recruitment, training and matching. This streamlining will reduce staff time spent on administrative tasks, reducing the time students must spend on a wait list. By keeping the wait list short, more English language learners will be matched with tutors efficiently to advance their individual language goals in an appropriate time frame.

We use the Laubach Reading book sets (level specific manuals such as phonics, workbooks, and reading stories) created exclusively for adult learners. The expected outcome is for the adult learner to achieve their own stated personal goal(s) as well as a one-level improvement in reading and comprehension.","Using the Slosson Oral Reading Test-Revised (SORT-R) the adult learner's reading level is assessed and the appropriate materials are assigned which are intended to help the learner increase at least a reading level during the program year. Thereafter, each quarter, the adult learner is given the SORT-R which enables us to track their progress and make appropriate adjustments in reading materials to be used. During the 2017-2018 program year, the program had 48 adult learners of which 20 were on track to meet the goal of an increased reading level. Fifteen learners remained flat - meaning there was no increase nor decrease in initial reading level. The remaining learners, 13, lost ground as a result of a myriad of issues (absence, personal issues, illness). Approximately 80% of our learners (about 38 adults) have some slight cognitive disabilities that impair their short-term memory, thus repetition is common with many of the tutors repeating previous lessons. The average age of our adult learner is 43 and of the 51 adult learners currently getting services, 45 of them did NOT graduate from high school, with ten of them seeking to obtain a GED. With this, we will continue to use the Laubach reading system, which allows most of our learners to be successful. We would like to add computer programs to the one-on-one tutoring to assist the adult learner with phonics, word sounds, word association and reading. Those who read at a 3rd grade level (10) there's a book club for them. ","The project is designed to meet each adult learner where they are - whatever their reading level and personal goals are, the project endeavors to meet, if not exceed their expectations. This is achieved through one-on-one tutoring, which fosters trust and helps build the confidence of the adult learner. The one-on-one tutoring occurs in either an isolated area or within an area where the adult learner is surrounded by other adult learners and their tutors. The tutors commit to one student, rarely two, providing tutoring for 1.5 hours to 2.0 hours weekly. The tutor's commitment tends to galvanize the learner and bonds are established - the tutor wants the learner to be as successful as they want to be. The use of the Laubach reading, while an important component, is successful due to the one-on-one tutoring provided.  Also, the book club for the adult learners who read at a 3rd grade level, helps to increase the members confidence while standing as another goal for the remaining adult learners. Now in its eleventh year, the book club has 10 adult learners as members who have tackled a myriad of literary genres, reading aloud which helps with word sounds and association. Lastly, workshops and ongoing training for the tutors are held several times throughout the project's program year.  These components assist in meeting the objective of the project - eliminate illiteracy.","We attempt to achieve the stated outcomes within one to three years. The project starts annually Sept. 1st and runs through June 30th, with sessions three times a week on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, from 9:30 am until 1:30 pm. On Wednesdays there is an evening session from 4:30pm until 6:30pm.  There is also an offsite location where 10 adult learners who live in an assisted living facility receive tutoring. During the program year, each adult learner receives no less than 1.5 hours a week; and, there are 20 who receive 2.0 hours a week. The adult learner and tutor commit to  tutoring for no less than 30 weeks over the project year, for at least 1.5 hours weekly, minimally once a week.  There are five adult learners who are tutored twice a week as they are seeking their GED and need to increase their reading level prior to taking GED classes.","The SORT-R (Slosson Oral Reading Test-Revised) is the method of measurement used to assess the adult learners reading level.  The SORT-R is designed to assess the level of oral word recognition, word calling or reading level.  It is a screening test to determine a student's reading level and is administered to the adult learner three times a program year - at the beginning o the year, three months later, then at the end of the program year.  It is NOT used as a learning tool. The Laubach reading series is also used and has worksheets the tutors use to assess the adult learners progress.","D'Estee, Inc. allows two floors of their headquarters to be used for the project, as well as the use of two lap top computers and an administrative office.  ","The project has at its disposal the use of two (2) lap top computers that were donated three years ago. At the time of the donation, the lap tops were already two years old and did not come equipped with operating systems. Currently, the lap tops are used by tutors in the loading of phonic videos and is shared with the adult learner.

Our small-group classes usually meet weekly for a minimum of two hours, depending on the agreements set with our partner locations and the needs of our students. The GED/HSE program runs for 12-15 weeks and meets twice a week for two hours each session. Tutors submit a monthly report detailing the number of hours spent with their student, and objectives and goals set and met.","To measure our program's success, LNJ uses the Tests of Adult Basic Education (TABE), an assessment approved by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, to evaluate students. The standard for federal funds eligibility is that 50 percent of students reassessed after 50 or more instructional hours will improve one proficiency level. Last year, LNJ exceeded this benchmark, with 71 percent of students gaining at least one proficiency level. With support from Dollar General, LNJ would expect similar results.In addition, LNJ asks students to set personal, employment and educational goals that they work toward in their lessons. LNJ staff contacts students and tutors monthly to track progress toward these goals and log instructional hours. LNJ expects 95 percent of students to achieve a personal goal. If our adult learners struggle with progress on the TABE or in reaching their goals, staff offers supplemental instruction and meets with tutors to refine their lesson plans.","All necessary facilities, equipment and supplies are available to LNJ tutors and staff to successfully implement our programs.

We expect the participants to complete this program and transition to the workforce immediately.  This program will assist employers in filling the jobs that require less than a 2-4 year college degree and  currently have a shortage of qualified applicants.","There are approximately 2538 individuals in Edmonson County who do not have a high school diploma.  Our goal is to enroll 100 of those individuals and have at least 14 attain their GED.  The goal of this GED Plus program is to concurrently enroll these students in a college or technical college program that will allow them to earn a short-term credential in one of the top high- demand employment sectors such as health care, manufacturing, transportation, or business.  In many circumstances, students have employment opportunities either while pursuing their credential or immediately thereafter.  The proceeds of this grant will be used to assist these individuals in attaining their GED and assisting in paying for fees, books, or expenses associated with earning their post-secondary credential.  The monies from this project will supplement the costs associated with earning the GED such as workbooks, materials, testing fees, operational costs, and technology.  Computer-aided software provides distance learning opportunities for those students whose schedule conflicts with center operating hours.  It is estimated that the average costs to obtain one of these short-term credentials is $800.  This project will assist those who do not qualify for a Work-Ready Scholarship.   Our goal is to recruit 30% of our GED seekers into the GED Plus Program, which will employ workers in the high- demand jobs that require less than a 2-4 year degree but provide sustainable wages.","Marketing materials describing the GED Plus Program will be distributed throughout the county as well as advertised in various types of social media.  Students will be given a detailed overview of the program during orientation with The Career Navigator.  Information will be provided on the steps needed to enroll in the desired program at either the technical college or WKU.  The Career Navigator will assist the student in completing all the necessary steps to become enrolled in the program.  Students will complete all testing requirements to become enrolled in Edmonson County Skills U to obtain the GED while pursuing the post-secondary credential.  The student will meet with a member of The Career Team to see if he/she qualifies for the Work-Ready Scholarship.  Those who do not qualify may receive proceeds from this project.  The student will have to complete 12 hours of instruction and pass one GED-Ready Test before receiving assistance.  The student must attain the GED before receiving the post-secondary credential.  Some of the short-term credentials will require certification testing.  The student will not be allowed to test for certification until the GED is attained.  The Kentucky Career Center will assist the student in finding employment upon completion of the program.  In many cases, students immediately gain employment after completing the program.  The student has the opportunity to continue education and obtain a career advancement in the same employment sector. ","The timeline will vary per student.  If a student enrolls at NRS levels 4-6, the number of instructional hours to obtain the GED should be much less.  Students in these levels should be able to obtain the GED in 1-3 months.  Students in level 4 should complete 40 hours of instruction before enrolling in post-secondary classes to ensure the student has the skill level needed to do college classes.  Students who enroll at level 5 only need to complete 30 hours of instruction before enrolling in college course.  Students who are at level 6 may enroll in college classes immediately upon enrollment.  Students must agree to attend six hours of face-to- face instruction and 4 hours of distance learning per week in GED classes.  The post-secondary classes will depend on availability of classes and requirements of the class.  The GED must be attained before the student may receive the post-secondary certificate or certification.  The student may not test for certification until the GED is attained.  ","The 11/12 TABE will be used to measure educational level gains after 30-40 hours of instruction.  The GED-Ready test will determine if a student has developed the required skills to pass the Official GED test.  If a student enters the program at NRS levels 4-6, a GED-Ready should be administered within the first week of instruction.  The GED-Ready test may be used to determine a plan of study for the student.  The test may be aligned to a series of workbooks or online software packages.  The Wonderlic Test is used to determine college readiness and is required for students choosing to enroll in college-credit-earning programs such as Accelerating Opportunity Kentucky.

In 2018, the READ Center received a donation of laptops and tablets that were deployed into classrooms that do not have access to computer labs. The laptops and tablets can be used for reference (e.g., looking up words in an online dictionary or practicing research techniques), for typing/writing practice, and to use the online app IXL to practice literacy and numeracy skills.  How digital learning is integrated into instruction depends on the class level and lessons being presented.After a successful pilot of an online reading app last year, READ subscribed to IXL, which provides practice for both reading and math. The app recommendation came from a READ student and has been generally well-received. The app allows students an opportunity to practice digital skills, as well as increase practice time for reading and math. IXL can be used on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Because health issues can be a barrier for many READ students, IXL provides the chance for students with online access to practice outside of the classroom. READ recognizes that many of its students do not have access to computers at home, but most have phones so digital learning includes smartphones. Students learn how to set up voice mail, set up email accounts using their smartphones, and how to text as part of digital literacy.

The night classes begin at 5:30pm and end at 8:30pm.  All students have access to our computer lab Monday-Thursday for additional online instructional models and many of our students take advantage of our distant learning opportunities at home.  Individual timelines vary based on the amount of instruction and remediation needed to prepare for the high school equivalency exam and ACT Work Keys assessment.  Some students will require more time than others based on their TABE pre- and post-test, HiSET practice test, and successful completion of all workforce preparation materials.  ","Every student is given a TABE Locator and TABE 11 during the intake process.  These TABE assessments measure competency in the areas of Reading, Language Arts, and Mathematics.  English Language Learners are assessed using the TABE ClasE test.  Their TABE scores determine their educational functioning level (EFL).  Students are placed in classes based on their EFL at the time of registration.  Any student scoring EFL 5 or 6 are fast tracked and can begin HiSET practice tests.  Students scoring below EFL 5 are provided an individual education plan and given instruction to assist them in their deficit areas. After 40 hours of instruction, students are post-tested to determine academic progress and measurable skills gain.  Students are registered for the HiSET exam after attaining scores of ""Adequately Prepared"" or ""Well Prepared"" on the official HiSET practice test.  All students in our Workforce class are administered an ACT WorkKeys Pretest in the areas of Applied Math, Graphic Literacy, and Workplace Documents.  Based on these scores, students are placed in levels 1-7.  After successful completion of the Career Ready curriculum, students are scheduled for the ACT Work Keys assessment.  ","The main campus of the PASALC is centrally located in Pascagoula, MS and is easily accessible from Highway 90.  This site can accommodate approximately 40 students at a time.  Our other three sites can provide for up to 30 students during each scheduled class time. PASALC added a computer lab in January, 2018 that houses 20 computers.

Therefore combination ESL/literacy classes are essential to improving their chances of achieving success and self sufficiency.",,"Our classes currently provide instruction in language and literacy to 50 resettled refugees. It also prepares them for citizenship exams and gives them practice in job interview and application skills. Expected outcomes would include English proficiency, citizenship, and employment. Less measurable benefits of the program come with the social groups established within the classes, helping refugees from various backgrounds gain a sense of community. ","The World Relief Fort Worth ESL/literacy program is tailored to meet the needs of resettled refugees. Therefore, it has three major objectives based on its three focus areas.1. Basic language acquisition and literacy: Some students are highly educated in their own language and simply need to focus on language learning. Others don't know how to hold a pencil. Groups must be established with different instructors in order to meet the students where they are. The language group focuses on developing vocabulary and grammar skills. The literacy group learns the English alphabet and practices writing it as they speak it. Outcomes are measured by Hope Literacy tests (designed for refugees learning ESL). As students advance in English skills, they will be evaluated with a TELPAS-style test.2. Citizenship: This phase is content-based instruction where students practice English while learning American history and civics needed to pass the citizenship exam. Worksheets, tests, and practice citizenship interviews are all included in this phase. Outcomes are measured by curriculum tests and success in gaining citizenship.3. Job interview: In this phase, students learn the specific vocabulary involved in filling out job applications and practice answering the questions that are typical in a job interview. Outcomes measured by in-class tests and success in gaining employment.","World Relief Fort Worth established its three-phase language and literacy pilot program in 2018 at Ladera Palms Apartments, which houses resettled refugees from Congo, Burma, Afghanistan, Bhutan, and many other countries. The program cycles through three phases of learning. The first is basic language acquisition and literacy. Some refugees are highly educated professionals who learn quickly while others are illiterate even in their native tongue. They must be evaluated and separated in groups with different instructors and course materials altered to meet their unique needs. The more highly educated focus on developing vocabulary and grammar skills. The literacy group learns the English alphabet and practices writing it as they speak it. Using some phonics principles, they learn English words and how to spell and write them.  The second phase focuses on equipping students to pass their citizenship exam. It is content-based instruction where students practice English while learning American history and civics needed to pass the citizenship exam. Worksheets, test, and practice citizenship interviews are all included in this phase. The third phase is designed to expose resettled refugees to the language and culture of the American job interview process. In this phase, students learn the specific vocabulary involved in filling out job applications and practice answering the questions that are typical in a job interview. Role plays serve a central part of this phase. ","Classes are offered to resettled refugees free of charge on Tuesdays and Thursdays 10 am to 12 noon at the Ladera Palms Apartments, home to thousands of resettled refugees in Fort Worth. Classes are offered in semesters: January through May and August through December. Since the refugee students generally begin at very low English-speaking levels, they are welcome to move at their own pace, especially since some are not literate in their own tongue. Since many begin at level 0, fluency will take time, but by taking assessment tests at the beginning and end of each semester, refugee students will see their progress. Some progress quickly, leading to citizenship and employment after the first semester. For others the process takes more time. This ESL programs seeks to encourage them to steadily show progress in language acquisition and US civics knowledge until they gain employment. Success in some passing their citizenship exams has served to motivate many to work toward their goals. ","World Relief Fort Worth's partner Hope Literacy has provided standardized assessment tests for very low-level English speakers. Evaluations are made at the beginning of the semester to establish each student's level. By the end of the semester, each student is expected to pass the next level exam.  For the citizenship portion, the ESL course uses US Immigration Services ""Quick Civics Lessons for the Naturalization Test."" Instructors create assessment tests taken straight from the guide which help refugee students practice, but the truest assessment comes when the student faces their naturalization exam.  Appointment for the citizenship interview and exam must be made many months, (sometimes even a year in advance) so this assessment is delayed, but the program has already seen success in this category.",Ladera Palms Apartments provides World Relief Fort Worth (as a refugee resettlement agency) with a clubhouse and one apartment for classes and special programs free of charge.,"Currently no technology is used in these classes.

Our rural area contributes to the lack of services available to residents who have no transportation. Allegany County encompasses a span of 1,029 square miles (US Census Bureau) across 29 towns. Lack of childcare and reliable transportation are two major barriers to educational goals.  Flexible scheduling and accessible locations are two of the key features of our program. Meetings are in-home or at another mutually acceptable location so child care and transportation are not obstacles to program access. This is especially helpful for students with special needs (like single parent households). Teachers work with individuals one-on-one. Students that have experienced disappointment with previous educational endeavors often need this personal attention to gain the confidence and self-esteem necessary to reach their goals. Pre and posttests with the TABE and the TASC Readiness Assessments are given to assess educational levels. Students focus on basic education, HSE preparation, employability skills, life skills and career goals. When a student is ready to take the HSE exam, teachers arrange for or provide transportation to the exam as needed. Those students who pass the HSE exam are invited to attend a graduation ceremony in recognition of their accomplishments.","The timeline for the proposed program would be the 12-month period from May 2019 -- April 2020 (unless a different timeline is required by the grant).

Reading and math levels can be different. To demonstrate an educational gain, a student must post test on the TABE at a higher educational level than the pretest.  For example, a student who enters at a 7.5 reading or math level must post test at 9.0 or above in order to make an education increase. Post testing is done after the first 30 hours of tutoring and after this, as needed. 2.

At this point, we are considering the CASAS assessment due to its reputation for being both comprehensive and testing English competency in everyday situations. We are also considering the TABE CLAS-E assessment. In order to establish which test best aligns with our focus on conversational English, we are in the process of meeting with our community partners that have first-hand experience with both of these assessment tools. ","SCN plans to purchase National Geographic's English in Action Workbooks and provide each student with notebooks and handouts to practice reading, writing, and speaking English.

After we assess the pilot program's first year in Chicago, we plan to expand the program to our other locations and add an intermediate level women's English class in Chicago. As the program grows, we also plan to invest in more technology conducive to teaching, such as whiteboards and a computer learning center, where students can sign up for additional practice through high quality online resources, such as Rosetta Stone and Learn English with Ted Talks.","We are using a paper workbook and notebooks. Our first instructional choice is National Geographic's English in Action Curriculum. Our plan is to begin the program in a low-technology way and add more technology into the program as it grows.

Obtaining a level gain through TABE 11&12 Testing requires administering a pre-test upon entering the program, having an individual program of study designed for the learner, obtaining the required 40 hours of program participation, and making the required improvements on a post-test to move to the next educational functioning level.  TABE 11&12 Tests indicate the readiness level of learners to succeed in passing all four parts of GED Diploma Testing.Earning a Career Readiness Credential through WIN Testing requires an individual to score at least a Level 3 on each of the three WIN Tests.  WIN Career Readiness Credentials show employers that the learner has certain employability skills for desired positions in different career fields.

While on par with New Jersey's unemployment rate, there are many municipalities within each county that suffer greatly from the economic disparity that exists in the New York Metropolitan region. For example, the cities of Passaic and Paterson have unemployment rates of 5.1 and 6.7 percent respectively.  ","The number of dropouts from Bergen County schools has increased greatly, from 168 in 2014-15 to 190 in 2015-16 -- an increase of approximately 13 percent. According to the Child Trends Databank, the proportion of youth and young adults who are high school dropouts has been on the decline, but disparities persist across racial/ethnic origin and foreign-born status. In Jersey City and Paterson, the school districts record only a 75 and 71% graduation rate respectively. ","In GBCA's service area, 16.5% of the Passaic County population is in poverty, 14.1% are living under the federal poverty line in Hudson County and Bergen County's poverty rate is 6.6 percent. But, there is a tale of two Bergen counties. For instance, in Garfield and Hackensack, where this program will be administered, the poverty rate is 17.7% and 14.3% respectively. On the opposite side of the county, in affluent towns like Alpine, Cresskill and Tenafly, poverty levels fail to reach 5%.  ","According to the latest figures tabulated through the National Center for Education Statistics' National Assessment of Adult Literacy, 17% of New Jersey adult residents lack basic prose literacy skills. In GBCA's geographic service area, a shocking 37 percent of Hudson County residents lack basis prose literacy skills, while 26% and 16% lack those same skills in Passaic and Bergen counties, respectively. ",,"This program will help 15 adults over the age of 24 attain their High School Equivalency certificates over the course of 32 weeks. Instruction, utilizing the Aztec TASC Prep Series software and informed personal instruction, will take place 10 hours a week. When our local residents cross the threshold of age 24, they no longer qualify for our Out-Of-School Youth HSE program, which is funded by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.","Objective 1: To implement an effective outreach/recruitment process which results in an enrollment list of 20-25 potential clients within 1.5 months of the marketing and enrollment kick-off.   Objective 2: Qualify 15 potential clients, from the first-come-first-serve enrollee list, authorizing they are above age for GBCA's Out-of-School Youth Program, and that they never obtained a high school diploma. Objective 3: Assess all 15 adult students and commence program on 9/1/2019. Objective 4: Complete HSE Preparation instruction in May, 2020, have students sign-up for and take the New Jersey equivalency test, TASC. It is anticipated that, by project end: 1.)	80 percent of 15 (12) adults will attain a HSE.2.)	87 percent of 15 (13) will attain basic skills, work readiness and occupational skills.Objective 5: Assist a minimum of 15 enrollees ages 24-plus in attaining employment, retention, earnings increase and supportive services though referrals to GBCA's spectrum of human, economic and community services. Also, refer all clients to local workforce development partners to hone their skills and apply their newly acquired educational acumen and credentials. ","GBCA's Adult HSE Preparation Program will have transformative effects on the lives of 15 adults from North Jersey who are being left behind in the workforce because they lack a high school diploma and basic skills knowledge associated with obtaining high school equivalency. The program was designed to fill a significant gap in adult HSE preparation. Currently, GBCA runs a successful Out-Of-School Youth HSE preparation program, but students must be under the age of 24 to enroll. That program, funded by way of the Bergen County Workforce Development Board and deployed in collaboration with major community stakeholders, locks out a significant population of adults who never received a high school degree and are inhibited by the lack of credentials. High school equivalency can open the doors to post-secondary education, new job skills and offers from employers who would normally never consider hiring a high school drop-out. The comprehensive 32-week course will prepare adult learners for the New Jersey TASC exam by providing them with instruction from an experienced educator and access to the Aztec TASC Prep Series software, which is a valuable in-class and remote learning tool that gives students 24/7 access to lessons, assessments, practice drills and test-taking strategies. Students will also be linked to services provided by GBCA and partner organizations to improve their overall well-being -- mentally, socially, and financially.","The GBCA Adult HSE Preparation Program will run approximately 32 weeks, enrolling 15 adult clients ages 24 and above in an intensive course utilizing online and in-person instruction leading to high school equivalency testing. The program total, one-year in duration, would commence July 1, 2019 with a comprehensive marketing and outreach campaign to enroll and screen potential adult clients seeking HSE certification. Classes would commence on September 1, 2019 and run through May 2020, with students attending classes two nights per week at Garfield or two nights per week at Hackensack from 6-8:30 p.m., for a total of five hours of weekly instruction. Utilizing the Aztec TASC Prep Series, students with unique user domains will be able to continue studying and practicing curriculum modules outside the classroom, a unique component that is not available at other adult prep courses in the region. GBCA will conclude the program in June by facilitating the registration of the students for the TASC examination.   ","The HSE staff will give each student the NJ Department of Labor and Workforce Development (LWD)-approved Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine class placement level. This baseline measurement tool will enable the Adult HSE instructor to properly prepare an individualized lesson plan for each one of the enrolled students. Utilizing the Aztec TASC Prep Series, ongoing test data will be used to generate and continuously adapt highly sensitive individual learning plans, and the instructor can utilize student learning plans to augment instruction and remediate individual skill gaps. The software has a bank of over 4,000 test items for unlimited assessments and practice drills. End of course testing will be measured against baseline data for each students' progression throughout the course and their strides in attaining benchmarks of the well-articulated curriculum. ","The GBCA Adult HSE Preparation Program will be administered at Greater Bergen Community Action's Education and Training Center in Garfield, NJ and at GBCA's headquarters in Hackensack, NJ - both of which are easily accessible by car, commuter bus and within walking distance of NJ Transit commuter train stations. These are well-supported and publicized sites for HSE programming, with proven track records of success. In the classroom/computer lab utilized at the Education and Training Center, there are 14 desktop computers and 20 laptops available to students. At GBCA headquarters, the training center will utilize laptops, and a computer enabled flat screen at the head of the class for instructor-led lessons. Both locations are handicap accessible, equipped with a single-occupancy wheelchair lift for those requiring that need. All instructional materials, supplies and requested technology upgrades will be procured and made available at the start of the 32-week course. The GBCA Education and Training Center, and GBCA headquarters, offer prep and testing leading to a variety of skills and knowledge to lower-income, older, and foreign-born individuals, which will help them achieve greater success in the job market and support their desire for a better future. Other programs offered are Citizenship Prep and English as a Second Language Classes.","GBCA's Education & Training Center utilizes the Aztec Learning System to prepare out-of-school youth to pass the TASC exam and obtain their HSE diploma -- the same software will be utilized in the proposed Adult HSE Preparation Program. Aztec is a web-based, online tool that individualizes learning for each participant and is approved by New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (LWD). GBCA utilizes the Aztec TASC Prep Series for its HSE instruction. In Garfield, at the GBCA Education & Training Center where the Adult HSE Preparation Program will be taught two nights a week, the classroom/computer lab is equipped with 14 desktop computers and 20 laptops. At GBCA headquarters, where classes will be taught two nights a week, laptops will be utilized.

GBCA currently holds 30 user accounts for the software, but would require extra user accounts to accommodate the enrollment of both the GBCA Out-Of-School Youth HSE Program and the Adult HSE Preparation Program that is outlined in this proposal. The Aztec TASC Prep Series software allows students to have access to their individualized lesson plans 24 hours a day through computers, tablets, laptops and even smart phones. This round-the-clock access lets students learn on their own time when not inside the classroom, something that is not offered at other adult HSE preparation programs in North Jersey. The advantages of Aztec are many -- it holds 72 new lessons that cover TASC subject areas, it has a bank of over 4,000 test items for unlimited assessments and practice drills, it provides real-time reports with explanations of correct answers, and the instructor has the ability to interface with students even when they are not in the classroom. ","$339,000.00 ","$15,000.00 ","The $15,000 request from Dollar General Literacy Foundation will fund a comprehensive adult high school equivalency preparation program -- an expansion of GBCA's highly successful and significantly needed Out-Of-School Youth HSE Program. The highest percentage of the funding request for the project would cover the costs of staff, at a collaborative amount of $13,020. Those costs would cover the HSE instructor, at 12 hours per week (10 instructional and 2 prep) for 32 weeks. Additionally, $1,000 would be allocated to the Director of Education and Training for administration and oversight of the program. Marketing staff salaries would account for $500 for the initial marketing, outreach and recruitment efforts dedicated to the program, and follow-up efforts to publicize the program and its partnership with Dollard General Literacy Foundation. Seven Aztec TASC Prep Series user accounts are requested at a collaborative cost of $1,400. Aztec is the state-approved web-based instructional software deployed by GBCA for HSE preparation.

However, the unemployment rate among residents in the poorer towns of Ossining and Mt. Kisco are higher, and the unemployment rate among patrons who visit CCNW is much higher. CCNW targets its services to the unemployed and underemployed, i.e., households facing a financial crisis.","This project will serve households served by the Ossining and Bedford Central school districts. According to the most recent data from the New State Department of Education (2017--2018), the Ossining School District has a 28% dropout rate (34% for Hispanic students) and Bedford Central School District has a 16% drop out rate (41% for Hispanic students).  ","This project will serve households from the towns of Ossining and Mount Kisco, NY. According to the 2017 American Community Survey (US Census), the poverty rate in Ossining is 8.9% (16.1% for Hispanic families) and the poverty rate for Mount Kisco is 9.5% (5.8% for Hispanic families). The project will serve a much higher percentage of poor residents because CCNW's constituents are almost all at or below poverty.","According to the National Center for Education Statistics most recent data (2003), 13 percent of people in Westchester lack basic literacy skills. One hundred percent of the people this project serves will be ESL persons, which are common in the geographic area.

Key outcomes are that 100% of adults will report improved English speaking and 95%will improve their reading and writing ability. CCNW has offered this program since 1997 and has a track record of success. We have helped over 1,000 students learn English and 100% of participants have reported that they improved their English reading and writing ability. ","The goal of CCNW's Adult Language Skills Program is to enable Westchester's population of low-income, Spanish-speaking recent immigrants to gain basic English language skills so they can secure stable employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. The specific objectives are*	To offer basic English Language Conversation and Advanced English classes, providing a progression of courses to advance their skill level.* To offer basic English Language Conversation and Advanced English classes, providing a progression of courses to advance their skill level.* To offer drop-in, one-on-one tutoring two days per week to aid and speed individual learning (Wednesday and Saturday, 10-12 am with CCNW volunteers). * To help prepare students who desire citizenship to be ready for the exam and promote language skills in the workforce.* To create a learning lab with iPads and computers for in-house self-use to improve language skills and develop reading comprehension.* To offer a lending library of ESL books for individual checkout.* To attract additional volunteer teachers so we can increase the number of students served.  ","CCNW offers the following ESL classes to adults, which we have offered since 1997:(1) ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONVERSATION. This beginner drop in session is offered twice a week for two hours in the mornings and focuses on improving conversation skills. No registration is required and we accept walk-ins. Teachers are volunteers with ESL experience and seniors from a local high school's Spanish Club. Attendance varies from 2-15 people each session. (2) ADVANCED ENGLISH. This course is offered twice a week for two hours; three sessions are held per year (i.e., winter, summer, and fall). Registration is required. The course is designed for individuals who have a basic knowledge of English and want to focus on preparing for the U.S. citizenship test and workplace language. The class is taught by an ESL teacher and assistant. Attendance varies from 8-12 people each session. Both classes are offered free. In all classes, we strive to provide one-on-one support and help each student master pronunciation, phrasing, intonation, and articulation. Because our program is growing and our students want more opportunities to learn, we are raising funds to add the following components:* One-on-one tutoring on-site and off-site.* Language lab creation with computer work stations so students can practice English independently.* A lending library that offers ESL books for individual check out so that participants can practice reading at home.  ","CCNW's Adult Language Skills program offers ESL learning opportunities year-round during the day and evenings, and on both weekdays and weekends to accommodate our constituents' schedules. Each component of our program has a different time schedule, as follows:* The English Language Conversation drop in tutoring sessions will be held year-round, twice per week on Wednesday and Saturday mornings from 10am - 12pm. * The Advanced English Class (10-week sessions) will be offered on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7pm - 9pm during winter and fall and during the summer, the class operates only on Tuesday evenings. * The lending library will be open year-round whenever CCNW is open, which is 10:00 a.m.-4:00 a.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, 12:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m. on Thursdays and 10:00 a.m.-1:00p.m. on Saturdays. The project continues an existing program and enhances it, so staff are in place to begin working toward the project objectives immediately after funding is received. ","CCNW's Program Manager will analyze both qualitative and quantitative data. The project will gauge success by measuring whether the project reached the objectives and outcomes described above. Course instructors will maintain records on the participants' attendance and completion. Course instructors will also have participants complete pre-course and post-course surveys with questions that will help the Program Manager determine program effectiveness and gauge improvement in skills, attitude, pay, and job opportunities, and more. The Program Manager will organize all of this data together and compare it to prior years.","The classes are held at our center, which has a temperature controlled and pleasant training classroom.

Box 123537 Fort Worth TX 76121,,Project BEST and Project Learn Expansion,"$14,000.00 ",90.0,No,14282,Urban/Metro,"The National Center for Education Statistics reports that adults lacking a HS diploma are always the least likely to be employed. In their 2017 study, they found 72% of those with a HS diploma were employed, compared to 57% without a diploma or equivalent. In our area, where employment rates are high, our students remain unemployed or underemployed at a much higher rate than those with a HS diploma and are much more likely to work cash jobs or seasonal jobs that do not sustain their families.","The 4-year graduation rate in Fort Worth is said to be 85.1% and in Arlington 84.1%; both with a dropout rate of 3%. We believe this may not be a accurate. Students who never enroll in HS when they move into the state, those living in extreme poverty or that move frequently or who are ""voluntarily"" withdrawn from school due to social, economic or other issues may not be counted in this number. These are the very students who find their way to our ABE/HSE classes and most in need of our programs.","More than 75% of children in Fort Worth schools are considered ""at risk of dropping out"" according to the district. This is due, in large part, to poverty and the impact of poverty on the children and their families. Almost a third of students have limited English proficiency. According to recent Census data, more than half of the families residing in the neighborhoods near our programs are at or below poverty. All our programs serve a majority of families that are at or below poverty.","According to Literacy Texas and the Texas Center for the Advancement of Literacy and Learning, nearly 1/5 of adults in Tarrant County lack basic prose literacy skills. A Central Connecticut State University study of adult literacy rates among 77 U.S. cities with populations over 250,000 placed Fort Worth at 53.5 and Arlington at 62.These are adults that cannot read well enough to get and keep basic employment. It's estimated that almost 2 million Texans have little or no English language skills.",,We will provide direct literacy instruction to 90 adult learners in our Project BEST and Project LEARN programs. We will offer high quality childcare to their children while they attend classes. We will offer high school equivalency test prep classes and our HSE students will be prepared for all or part of the HiSET exam. Our Project LEARN students will improve their reading and writing skills in preparation for the workforce and/or Community College enrollment.,"Our HSE program follows the ""I Do, We Do, You Do"" teaching method, in which we introduce a concept, teach it to students, lead students through the concept together, then students work independently to master the concept. This is repeated until students master the concept and move on to the next concept. Our goal: Prepare the students to pass the HSE exam, the first step toward a better job and/or entry into Community College. We teach small groups (3-6 students per teacher, 15-20 students per semester) at the same level in that subject. Progress is monitored to identify gaps and close those gaps. We plan to utilize funds from this grant to expand Project BEST into at least two new community organizations that we will partner with to spread the program into under-served areas.Our Adult Basic Education program is called Project LEARN (Literacy Education and Reading Network) and consists of trained volunteers who work one on one with individual students using the Barton Method or Laubach and other printed materials to help students improve their basic reading and writing skills. We are also planning to expand this program into local community organizations, recruit and train 20-25 new volunteers and find adult learners that need reading enhancement services. This will include further development and growth an online tutor training service combined with monthly in-person trainings. ","Our HSE program meets two nights a week (Tuesday and Thursday) from 5:30 to 8:00 pm at the White Settlement Family Resource Center during the school year. During the summer, the class meets one night a week and focuses solely on mathematics, which is generally the most difficult subject for our adult learners. These classes are taught by trained volunteers under the guidance of Coalition staff. Our plan for expansion will include the hiring of an additional staff member that will not only monitor current programming but will create a blueprint and implementation manual and provide support for programs that are willing to take on this valuable educational opportunity.In Project LEARN, volunteers meet one on one with their assigned students at least once a week to offer tutoring in reading and writing. Tutoring is offered at the Coalition offices and in partnership with local community organizations, such as public libraries.In each program, staff members provide the administrative oversight for the program and supervise the trained volunteers who provide the instruction for the students. Attendance and participation records are maintained, progress of individual students is monitored, and professional development opportunities are provided to the volunteers throughout the year to encourage high quality instruction. Our goal is to build stronger communities through connection to resources and training, and therefore improve overall program quality in Tarrant County.","Our HSE test preparation program (Project BEST) runs throughout the school year, along the school calendar. As noted above, we run a Summer Math Academy which focuses solely on mathematics instruction. New students may enroll in the program at the beginning of each semester - Fall, Spring and Summer. During the regular sessions, instruction is provided 5 hours per week (Tuesday and Thursday evenings). The Summer Math Academy meets one night a week for 2.5 hours per class. Our goal for Project BEST expansion is to have at least two new sites up and running by May/June of 2020. This will allow time to make a needs assessment and reach out to interested parties in the fall and winter of 2019.The ABE program (Project LEARN) accepts students anytime throughout the year. Volunteers generally meet with their students for 1.5-2.5 hours per session, at least once a week. The only restrictions to when these one-on-one sessions meet are those the location puts in place, especially regarding space availability and hours of operation. Processes are already underway to secure additional partners that will offer space to these tutor/student pairs and online training is constantly  developed throughout the year.","As noted, we use the TABE assessment tool when students enter our HSE classes. Once they are enrolled, we use the HiSET practice test to identify when students are prepared to take the actual test. Each student is given an opportunity to take at least one practice test in math and language arts by the end of each semester. We focus on these two subjects because math is generally the most difficult for students (therefore, Thursday night instruction is solely devoted to math) and because language arts reading and writing instruction is key to passing social studies and science as well as language arts subject tests. By utilizing the HiSET practice test as a follow up assessment tool, we are able to determine the essential skills a student may be lacking and teach those skills, so he/she can take and pass the exam. ABE students are assessed on an individual basis, depending on whether their tutors are using the Barton Method, Laubach materials or other materials (often supplied by New Readers Press).","We have partnered with the White Settlement Family Resource Center since we began Project BEST High School Equivalency Classes in 2011. In the fall of 2017, the district provided a new space for our classes in a building which houses the district's services for students with special needs. This building offers large classrooms, a library, a computer lab, and a childcare room which work extremely well for our program. The location is convenient for our students and volunteers and is provided to us at no charge. Our ABE students study in classrooms provided by Agape Baptist Church, where we also have our offices. The church provides classroom space and childcare at no cost to the students or our organization. The Literacy Coalition, in partnership with LinkEd, work jointly to provide students and volunteers with curricula and instructional materials at no cost to the students. Tarrant Literacy Coalition oversees the administration of the program, volunteer recruitment, and supervision of the program. Supplies and curricula purchased with these funds will go to students in our currently operating programs as well as in ""site kits"" to be created and distributed to our expansion sites.","We are very fortunate to have access to technology at each of our sites. Our Project BEST class is located at the White Settlement Family Resource Center, where we have a computer lab with four desktop computers. These computers are currently 2 years old, but have the appropriate software for HSE students. Wi-fi is available and we have laptop computers we can take to the school for additional use. The majority of our ABE classes are held at the same site as our offices and we have Wi-Fi in the building as well. We have some laptop computers available on an as-needed basis.

While most students want to complete studies as soon as possible, the reality of Adult Education is each student works on their own individual schedule. Students' schedules may depend on child care, transportation, work schedules, and other issues.  The students' incentives, commitment, and determination are huge factors in the time each student requires to obtain their educational goals.

If the student shows proficient improvement, they may take the Official GED PT in the subject of their choice. This test is available in all 4 GED subjects.  The result will be ""likely to pass"", ""too close to call"", or ""unlikely to pass"".  Students who score ""likely to pass"" may then take the GED exam in that particular subject.  Students scoring ""too close to call"" and ""not likely to pass"" received a printout of the subject skills they need to review and improve to pass the GED exam.College Prep students take the ACCUPLACER and/or SAT exams.

(3) 60-65 adult learners who attend at least 19 of 24 classes will report high satisfaction (3 on a 4-point Likert scale) with (a) the overall program, (b) their personal progress learning English, (c) increased comfort with speaking English outside of the program, and (d) their teacher(s) on a questionnaire developed by the program. ","Following an orientation meeting that includes assessment of proficiency in listening, writing, and speaking English using BEST Literacy and Best Plus assessments, we place adult learners in the appropriate level of English class (beginning, advanced beginning, low intermediate, high intermediate). Instruction takes place for 3 hours on 12 Saturday mornings in the fall and 12 more in the spring for a total of 72 hours of ""Real World"" English language instruction. Instructors for the first three levels are bilingual in Spanish so they can offer support and answer questions for the majority of our students who are native Spanish speakers. The high intermediate class is taught completely in English by native English speakers. Instruction for every class includes multiple opportunities for adults to practice reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills in English in thematic units based on ""real world"" topics such as the Community, Parents Rights and Responsibilities in the U.S. Educational System, Job Skills and Career Opportunities, Medical, Health, Nutrition and Wellness, and Financial Literacy. Homework is given each week for additional practice, and a tutor is available mid-week for those who want homework help. Post-assessments and program evaluations will be completed during the final weeks of the program. The RWE program also offers a free children's program that includes STEAM-based activities while the adult classes are held.","Spring 2019: Because the Real World English program has been in operation since January 2015, we will administer post-assessments of current RWE students, evaluate the 2018-19 RWE program so we can make needed adjustments based on student feedback, and recruit volunteers for the 2019-2020 program. All teachers have already agreed to participate in the 2019-2020 program.Summer 2019: Hold two planning meetings, secure training of our assessor to administer the BEST Plus 2.0 oral assessment of speaking and listening, and recruit new adult students.Fall 2019: An orientation, which includes pre-testing, will take place on September 7, 2019 followed by 12 three-hour classes offered every Saturday morning through December 7, 2019 when post-testing will occur. A total of 36 hours of instruction will be offered. Debriefing meetings are held after every class for teachers to discuss their students' progress, share lesson ideas, and adjust plans as needed.Spring 2020: On January 18, 2020, we will hold another orientation, including pre-testing for new students and classes will run through May 2, 2020, when post-testing will occur. A total of 36 more hours of instruction will be offered. Debriefing meetings are held after every class for teachers to discuss their students' progress, share lesson ideas, and adjust plans as needed.","Pre- and post- assessments will include the (1) BEST Literacy Test to assess reading and writing proficiency, (2) BEST Plus Test 2.0 to assess listening and speaking proficiency, and (3) a program-designed questionnaire to assess self-reported student satisfaction with the overall program, progress learning English, increased use of English, and teacher(s). These are all summative measures.Teachers will use weekly formative assessments to adjust their instruction. Formative assessments may include: (a) homework completion and accuracy, (b) spelling tests, (c) oral dictation tests, and (d) a variety of performance assessments based on application of curriculum content to include (e) oral reading and/or (f) writing assignments, and (g) observations of student interest, motivation, and progress and continued.Students will also review portfolios of their accumulated work, and make oral recordings of their reading and speaking, at least twice during each 12-week session. This will be a new assessment component for Real World English program and an additional way to assess progress in reading, writing, speaking and listening.","Allen Middle School (AMS) in Guilford County has been the location for Real World English classes since January 2015 and will continue to house the RWE program in 2019-2020. AMS has one of the largest culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in the school system. Many AMS parents attend Real World English classes, although about 50% of our adult students now come from other schools throughout Guilford County. All classrooms are equipped with necessary equipment for adult instruction, including adult-size furniture. The classrooms accommodate up to 25 adults, and there are enough computers in the media center and CTE classroom for each adult to use individually. The media center, cafeteria, and gym area comfortably house whole-group meetings, simulations, celebrations for adult learners, and provide space for the children's STEAM activities.

We also provide numerous options for distance and computer-based learning. Each week, more than 1100 individual students pass through our doors to attend classes.SPPS ABE curriculum is written by our highly qualified teachers, who regularly adapt and enhance it to meet student needs. Minnesota recently introduced a set of academic content standards for ABE, a requirement of the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), called the College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS). The CCRS define three key instructional shifts -- complexity, evidence, and knowledge -- to increase academic rigor in ABE and ensure students gain the critical thinking skills required for work and further schooling. To align with CCRS, both of the standardized tests we are required to use to measure learning gains (TABE and CASAS) have introduced or are in the process of creating new assessment packages. SPPS ABE plans to use some of the funds requested from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation to purchase new assessment packages. ","Classes operate year-round and are roughly aligned with the St. Paul Public Schools academic calendar. We have an extended summer school session (8-10 weeks) that is open to all adults. Our two main sites are open for classes from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 - 4 on Friday. Distance learning can be accessed anytime; distance learning orientation and open computer lab hours are available at both locations daily. Learners are encouraged to attend as many hours of class as possible each week and to enroll in distance learning. Learning center staff make every effort to accommodate learner requests for additional programming, specialty classes (i.e. Fun with Fractions, Writing Lab and CASAS Prep) and job training classes. SPPS ABE strives to offer classes that fit into adult learners' busy lives, and students may attend classes as few as six hours per week (we have two-day per week class options) or as many as 25+ hours per week. Most students attend at least 12 hours of class per week. SPPS ABE is required to begin using the new, CCRS-aligned version of the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) assessments, TABE 11 and 12, and discontinue using old versions by July 1, 2019. We are beginning to pilot the new tests this spring and plan to use them exclusively with all TABE-level students by July 1, 2019. We will purchase and being using the new CCRS-aligned version of the CASAS test as soon as it is available.","To assess learning gains, students will be given the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) and/or the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE), both state-approved standardized ABE tests. Students are tested at intake using the appropriate test (ESL students generally take CASAS and advanced ESL/GED students take the TABE) and after each 40 hours of classroom/distance learning instruction thereafter. We are starting to pilot use of the new version of TABE (11/12) and will be required to use only the new version of the test beginning July 1, 2019.Digital literacy students will be assessed using the Northstar Digital Literacy Assessment, a nationally-recognized system that measures computer proficiency in 10 main areas.Career pathways students will report their employment progress to their teacher, who will record job attainment, retainment and improvement in the SID database, the system that the Minnesota Department of Education requires ABE programs to use for student tracking.Teachers will also use the SID database to track post-secondary enrollment for students who are preparing for college.","The 42,600 sq. foot Hubbs Center is a dynamic adult education facility located in the heart of Saint Paul's Frogtown-Midway communities.

Measurable outcomes include an 85% retention rate for non-jail learners, improved scores on formal assessment tests and accomplishments like gaining employment, being promoted, completing parole, achieving citizenship and passing sections of a HSE exam. Achieving these objectives will improve education levels, create access to more and better jobs and a higher standard of living, improve the lives of participants' children and ultimately help to attract more jobs to the area.","We offer 1-to-1 tutoring, small classes and workshops in ABE, HSE, ESL, Citizenship, computer skills and job-related skills in Silver City, Santa Clara and Bayard. We also teach Parenting and Poetry classes at the jail. Read 2 Me connects parents to their children through reading, as children are not allowed to visit the detention center. We tape a parent reading a children's book aloud, and deliver the DVD and book to the child's home.We provide training and instructional materials for our volunteer tutors, who we match with students based on schedules, subject matter, initial skill level of student, and tutor expertise, teaching style and cultural sensitivity. Our projects are learner-centered: students set their own goals and pace. This approach is effective for students with low skill levels who have had negative experiences with traditional classroom-based learning.","These are ongoing projects which will continue after the grant period. Instruction over the 1-year grant period will include:1-to-1 Tutoring: Instructional hours for 1-to-1 tutoring vary. Most tutor/learner pairs meet once/week for one hour. A motivated adult may meet twice/week with their tutor, and receive 140 or more hours of instruction over a year's time. Some learners drop out entirely after 2 or 3 meetings. Others begin instruction, stop for a few months, then return and work consistently. Evening ESL classes meet once each week for 1 to 2 hours. Classes and tutoring hours at the jail are often constrained or interrupted by lockdowns or lock-outs, but most meet for an hour each week.The length of time a learner stays with LLL for instruction also varies greatly. Factors influencing this include the students' skill level at the start of instruction; students' availability to receive hours of instruction and the difficulty of achieving the students' goal. For example, one woman in her 30s who had left school in the 8th grade spent two years working with LLL tutors to eventually pass the GED exam. A high school graduate who needed to brush up on his math skills spent 6 months with a tutor before taking a vocational skill exam. A job seeker may attend three 2-hr workshops and find a job within two months.","Assessment vehicles include the Slosson Oral Reading Test within 1-2 weeks of placement with an instructor. In March, 2019 we will begin using CASAS instead of TABE. We will give the appropriate CASAS Locator Test as soon as possible after instruction begins. We will re-test using CASAS to track improvement after 100 hours of instruction or just before the learner leaves our project. Tutors hand in a tracking form at the end of each month for each learner. They note prep time, travel time, hours of instruction, hours of instruction using computers, provide brief descriptions of what was covered during instruction and any major milestones the learner has achieved. Tutors and learners often stop by the administration office and provide verbal feedback on how instruction is going. The Office Manager enters all quantitative data and information about outcomes into the LACES database. We also keep paper files for each student, where we also note qualitative information relevant to the learner's progress.","We have good relationships with facilities managers in several towns. Our administrative office is in the Silver City Public Library, which provides us with a cubicle, phone, internet and meeting rooms for tutoring, classes, and training events. The office has one large monitor, a printer and copy machine. Staff use laptops and share use of the monitor. We purchase software from sites that offer discounts to nonprofits. The books and materials we use have been donated or bought with grant funds. We have completed tax-exempt documentation to qualify for tax-free purchases at Walmart and Amazon, and purchase office supplies and tutoring materials (ink cartridges, paper, writing implements, books)  as needed. The annual cost for supplies is relatively low. Our evening ESL classes meet at Miller Library on the campus of WNMU, and at the Santa Clara Firehouse. We hold Basic Computers workshops at Bayard Public Library and the Santa Clara Housing Authority, which houses low income residents. Administrators at the Grant County Detention Center provide jail orientations. Our tutors have access to training, professional development opportunities, online resources, and a large collection of books, handouts and workbooks.","We offer computer-assisted learning as well as instruction in the use of technology.

We would like to increase the Program Director's salary to $36,000 for a full time position, and if possible, bring the Office Manager's hours up to 20 hours/week from 15. The Program Director manages programs, outreach, events, communications and publicity. She also writes and manages grants averaging $50,000 per year. This raise would allow her to resign from her second job, and spend more, and more focused, time at LLL. The Office Manager position requires people skills, tech skills, office management (paying and recording income and expenses) and the ability to multi task under pressure. This position has turned over 4 times in the last 4 years. Employees with these skills usually move on to a fulltime position. Increasing hours to 20 per week might help with retaining the other, key, staff position. The effect on the project would be to stabilize key staff, reduce turnover, and allow our project to grow.

Alabama is in the Blackbelt of the US, and the rate of unemployment is 7 % or higher in some the service counties, including Wilcox County at 8.75% unemployment, according to the AL Dept of Labor. The unemployment rate continues to rise in targeted service area as main employers are leaving the area. Just recently, the City of Selma laid off 61 employees recently in November 2018.","Alabama's number one education and economic problem is High School (HS) dropouts. AL's dropout rate is over 28.2%, one of the worst HS dropout rates in the nation, according to the AL Dept of Public Health. The estimated dropout rates for the targeted service areas varies between the extremes of 43% in Dallas County, to over 89% in Wilcox County. For the business community, this means that workers are inadequately prepared to operate in the modern, technology-driven workplace.","According to the Census Bureau, AL is the sixth poorest state in the US, with almost 18% Alabamians living below the federal poverty line. The Blackbelt have even higher rates of poverty than other areas of the state, with most counties living below the poverty line. The poverty rate is higher than 30% in the targeted service areas. Concentrated communities of poverty such as these have a high probability of crime, and few having the opportunity to attain a decent standard of living","According to the Literacy Council of West AL, 25% of Alabamians are functionally illiterate. Functional literacy goes beyond the ability to read, write or use math skills, and requires competence with technology. According to the Dept of ED, 60% of the unemployed lack the basic digital skills necessary to be trained for entry level positions in any industry.   In the targeted service area, the illiteracy rate is between 24 - 30 %.

This project aims to develop the knowledge, competencies and mindset to enter the economy by providing a set of digital literacy workshops. The digital literacy curriculum includes two workshops for 100 participants. Practical outcomes include creating an email account, developing an online resume, and practicing job searching tools using the Internet. ","This series of workshops will address providing basic digital literacy skills through an applied learning approach. The intended participant is an adult learner who has one or more of the characteristics noted above (poverty, unemployment, lack of technology skills). Thus, the overall goal of these workshops is to increase basic digital competence for the participants. The participants will have practical, relevant literacy experiences that utilize supportive resources in community. Participants will return for a second workshop that will allow them to search and find a potential job. The workshops will be developed to be sustainable and supported through the following methods:-	Providing the workshops in conjunction with the main educational provider in the targeted service areas -- Wallace Community College Selma (WCCS)-	Developing the curriculum to support past and future workforce development programs from WCCS-	Connecting the workshops curriculum to other professional development resources in the community, such as the GED initiatives; a professional development session will be held with the Career Center, WCCS, and the GED Center at the library.-	By the end of the digital literacy workshops, the participants will able to:-	Create a Gmail account-	Send and receive an email-	Demonstrate how to save a document in the Cloud-	Design a professional, online resume-	Create a job search on the Internet","The realm of literacy extends far beyond the classroom and includes issues such as a computer, navigating the web, and competence with technology. The main design of the workshops will be a set of two, 3-hour workshops (6 hours total time). The curriculum will look at familiarizing the participants with the Internet, searching the web for information, understanding how to save information, creating a professional resume, and communicating using email. During the first 3-hour workshop, the focus will be on setting up an email, using the Cloud, and drafting a resume. The participants will have practical, relevant homework that includes individual resume revision, accessing the Internet, and using resources in community, such as the Career Center. Participants will return for the second workshop the following week, and will engage in activities that allow them to search and find a potential job. This framework utilizes best practices for the adult learner in the following ways:-	Applied, relevant learning-	Individual attention-	Peer to peer learning and discussion-	Short timeframes The learning from the workshops will be sustained with resources in the community (Internet and computers), and the use of free technology programs in the Cloud, such as Gmail and  GoogleDocs. In addition, the learners will be exposed to other workforce development programs and resources at WCCS during the workshops.","The PI for this grant will develop the workshop content, curriculum, and materials . As mentioned previously, each workshop will be conducted in a 3-hour timeframe, with the second workshop occurring one week after the first, in order to encourage retention of information on the content.  The workshops series will be offered 5 times for 10 workshops. There will be three offered in early fall, sometime in August, after school starts, and children are in school. Parents will therefore be able to attend without the concern of childcare. The other two will be offered after the New Year, in early spring, to coincide with new business hiring.","The assessment methods will include the following-	Posttest vs Pretest Digital Literacy scores-	Attendance of the participants returning to second workshops -	Number of email accounts created-	Number of emails sent and received -	Number of resumes completed-	Number of documents saved to the Cloud-	Number of job applications submittedIn addition, participant follow-up at the various resources in the community may be a way to assess the workshops.

Those with jobs are often underemployed, working part-time or seasonally  or at jobs with low wages, poor benefits, and little opportunity for advancement. ","The high school drop-out rate for the state of Iowa was 2.8% in 2018. However, this rate is not reflective of the students served by CMC, who are almost all refugees and immigrants representing more than 50 countries of origin.

Most instruction is delivered by more than 350 trained community volunteers, who meet weekly with students for at least one hour. In addition to individual tutoring, students can supplement their learning with guided independent study, small group conversation classes, and workplace English group classes. Students are assessed at intake to determine which programming and curriculum are most appropriate for their learning level and goals, and to match them with an appropriate volunteer tutor. In the past few years, CMC has put increased focus on researching and developing best practices for serving students with emerging literacy, or those with little or no formal literacy education in their native language, which comprise approximately 10% of CMC students. In addition to developing and implementing programming at CMC to better serve these learners, CMC has been able to share these tools and resources with other ABE programs in the Midwest through conferences, workshops and email correspondence.

The Adult Basic Education Program accepts both students and volunteers on an ongoing basis. Two-hour orientations for new tutors are held twice monthly, in which volunteers are introduced to adult literacy education principles, program details, and materials. Tutors then participate in shadowing and coaching in their first months as tutors, and ongoing training opportunities throughout the year. New students complete a basic intake and assessment, and then are added to a wait list until they can be paired with a tutor. Those on the waiting list are invited to participate in group conversational groups and guided independent study, if appropriate, while they wait to begin individual tutoring. Students and tutors meet weekly for an average of 1.5 hours. All eligible students complete written and verbal testing twice annually. Students are welcome to continue study for as long as they wish, but the average length of study is approximately 2.5 years, with a year-to-year retention rate of 70%. Of those that leave the program, employment is one of the primary reasons for discontinuing study.  ","CMC uses the Side by Side English curriculum and its corresponding test materials to measure progress for most English Language Learners, as well as TABE testing for more advanced students. Assessments are administered after completion of each level to determine if a student needs additional review or practice before proceeding to the next level. General testing is administered twice yearly to all active students in the Fall and the Spring.  ","The majority of instruction takes place at the Center's main facility at 866 4th Ave SE, which is centrally located close to bus routes and other social service agencies.

MasterKey works to strengthen families by providing the resources that will assist them to stabilize. This program works to develop language skills that will allow an adult to get a better paying job, interact more effectively in their community, and enable them to communicate with their children and their schools. By providing an entrance exam to determine proficiency, offer intermittent tests to evaluate progress, and assigning new levels as their are achieved, MAsterKey provides a tangible way to monitor progress and encourage participation. The goal for each student is to achieve one level per year of enrollment. That is a high goal and half of the participants will need to attend longer due to interruptions in attendance or low educational levels in their first language. Regardless, MasterKey encourages, supports, and inspires. ","MasterKey Adult Education takes the whole language approach that includes reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English. This strategy allows for the student to be successful in the English-speaking community in all areas of engagement. Five Major Components:1. Reading - Students begin  with letter recognition with a simple phonetic approach. Lessons advance to reading word groups and later books. Reading books as a group improves comprehension and builds confidence.2. Speaking - Each class includes modeling of conversation by the teacher and multiple opportunities for students to orally participate. 3. Listening - Students are given instruction in English with visual and nonverbal supports. Students are exposed to English that develops the ear for the language. In addition, recordings and computer program applications are used for listening skill development. 4. Writing- Starting with step by step grammar instruction, students advance in writing ability. By graduation, all students are able to write a well constructed essay. 5. Project based learning - using practical experiences that every community resident is exposed to, teachers develop participatory activities that give each student practice and confidence to succeed. Themes such as ""Going to the Doctor"" and ""Speaking with Your Child's school"" are examples of experiential learning that introduces new vocabulary, assists students with recognizing questions, and giving appropriate answers. ","Each school year begins in September with a proficiency exam. Students are placed in one of three levels. Each week five hours of instruction are provided. Fall semester ends with the beginning of the Christmas holidays and the spring semester resumes in January. The spring semester concludes at the end of May and a six week program is offered to prevent summer language loss. If every class is attended, a student will receive 210 hours of English language instruction per year. ","The program uses the Side by Side Curriculum proficiency evaluation at the beginning of the year. This test includes written questions and an oral assessment. After English proficiency is determined and a class is assigned, teachers use the Side by Side test booklets for each level to provide exams that are written for each unit. In addition, teachers may create review quizzes for the beginning of each lesson that covers the previous class learning.

While the low unemployment rate is a positive, it can be tough for some students to attend classes. Many of the county residents who need Adult Education work in jobs with varying shifts, long hours, and seasonal variations, making the availability of tutors important. Manufacturing and retail provide 27.2% of the jobs in McHenry County.","The high school graduation rate in McHenry County in the 2016 academic year was 94% overall, but only 89% for low-income students (http://ilpovertyreport.org). The community of Harvard in McHenry County had a graduation rate of only 69% in the same year, well below the state average of 85% (illinoisreportcard.com). Twenty-nine percent (29%) of students at Harvard High School are chronically absent, and the 4% dropout rate is far above the state average of 1%. ","In 2017, 6% of people (18,471 residents) in McHenry County lived in poverty (census.gov). This directly relates to education: 13.3% of those in the county with less than a HS diploma live in poverty, while only 1.6% of those with a bachelor's degree or higher do. All of the literacy students served by MCC's AE program have less than a high school diploma, and the majority (74%) are Hispanic. In 2017, 13.6% of Hispanic county residents lived in poverty, compared to only 4.5% of white residents.","According to intake data, 80% (180 of 226) of MCC's ABE/ASE students and 73% (339 of 463) of MCC's ESL students have low or intermediate literacy levels. Nearly 6,000 county residents left school before the 9th grade (census.gov). Only 68% of McHenry County's Hispanic residents have a high school diploma, compared to more than 95% of white residents. Based on education level, 19,504 of McHenry County's residents over the age of 18 could benefit from Adult Education services (census.gov).",,"This project will support the literacy students in MCC's tutoring program, including 125 of the most vulnerable: those who are not literate in their native language, and those who need additional support to succeed. Approximately 100 students will receive wraparound support services such as gas cards and 25 students will receive individualized literacy training in Spanish. Students will improve their literacy by at least one standardized level, as measured by pre- and post-testing.","MCC's Adult Volunteer Literacy (AVL) program provides high-quality literacy tutoring to adult students throughout the county. Each year, approximately 130 trained volunteers provide individual or small group tutoring to 400 people with beginning levels of literacy, as defined by National Reporting System (NRS) standards. The goal of the AVL program is to improve students' literacy levels as measured by pre- and post-testing. Once students reach intermediate levels of literacy, they will be enrolled in ABE courses at MCC.  This project will provide additional support to 100 of the students in the AVL program who are determined to be at-risk of not completing their literacy education due to unmet economic or instructional needs. MCC's highly qualified program coordinator will assess student need in order to decide which students will be offered transportation support and/or referrals to other support agencies. In addition, 25 beginning literacy students who speak only Spanish will receive literacy tutoring in Spanish. To succeed, these students must attain literacy in their own language first, before learning to read in English. Students will complete regular post-testing to assess their point gains on nationally-recognized tests such as the TABE, CASAS, or BEST. One of the desired outcomes of this project is that students will improve their literacy levels to low intermediate or above, becoming eligible to enroll in ABE classes.","The AVL program provides free literacy tutoring to approximately 400 students per year. The program serves students at the beginning levels of literacy. Because of their low literacy skills, these students often struggle to find gainful employment, or must work low-paid jobs with long hours and unpredictable schedules. AVL personnel at MCC estimate that 100 students would benefit from additional assistance, including transportation support such as gas cards, or referrals to social support agencies such as food pantries. This additional support will allow students to enroll in and complete the AVL program.In addition, there is a recent increase in the number of students who need literacy services in Spanish. With funding from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, MCC will train bilingual volunteers who can replicate the work we currently do in English in order to reach additional students. MCC will also purchase additional academic materials in Spanish. All students are pre-tested when they enroll in the AVL program. At the end of the academic year (or sooner if necessary), students will be post-tested to re-assess their literacy levels. Students who have reached the intermediate literacy level or equivalent will be enrolled in ABE courses. Students who have not yet reached the intermediate level will continue to receive specialized tutoring, with the goal of improving their literacy levels so they can enroll in ABE courses.","May 2019 -	Grant awards are announcedJune -- August 2019 -	Outreach and recruitment of students and bilingual volunteers.-	Students complete MCC's intake and assessment process-	Tutors receive 10 hours of training to provide tutoring in Spanish -	Specialized instructional materials designed for students with beginning levels of literacy, including materials in Spanish, are orderedAugust -- December 2019-	Volunteers and students meet on a regular basis for one-on-one or small group tutoringo	Students receive between two and four hours of tutoring per week, in English or Spanish as appropriate-	100 at-risk students who need wraparound services are provided with gas cards and referred to additional social support agencies as appropriateJanuary -- May 2020-	Volunteers and students continue to meet on a regular basis for one-on-one or small group tutoringo	Students receive between two and four hours of tutoring per week, in English or Spanish as appropriate-	After no more than 40 hours of tutoring, students are given a post-test such as TABE, CASAS or BESTo	Students who have reached intermediate levels of literacy (as defined by the NRS) are enrolled in MCC's Adult Basic Education classeso	Students who are still at the beginning level continue to receive tutoringApril 2020-	Grant ends-	Final report with year-to-date information submitted in April 2020","All students will receive an initial assessment before entering the program.

By attaining a diploma or equivalency, the median annual wage jumps to $35,170 - a 75% difference. Starting with learning the English language and obtaining a GED is great, but the value of added training after those steps only increases a person's potential to earn a higher wage which will adequately support a family. All our programs are integrated with this end-result in mind.New Hope's program model can be viewed as an ala cart menu of programs and services rather than an organized program that people proceed through in a sequential fashion.

Latinos are also heavily represented in occupations with a higher likelihood of hazards, or even fatality, like the service industry (23% of Hispanics) or construction and maintenance (25% of Hispanic men).","Madison Metropolitan School District's dropÂ­-out rates for the 2017-2018 school year (grades 7 through 12) were Hispanic (1.5%) versus Non-Hispanic White (0.8%), and nearly 20% of hispanic students did not graduate in four years.

The majority receive state benefits (health insurance, food share).","United Way of Dane County's study indicates that 30% of Latinos in Dane County are illiterate in English. Some of the ways that low literacy impacts nearly one in three Latinos in our county include fewer job opportunities, barriers to using computers and technology, and poorer health as a result of difficulty reading medication instructions or communicating with medical professionals.

This translates to obtaining jobs with higher wages (at least $15/hour), better hours and benefits, and potential for career advancement. For many of our students, the first steps to a better job include enrolling in an adult basic education or pre-GED program, taking ESL classes, or obtaining the GED diploma. The project we are requesting funding for, the Academy for Latino Adult Education, encompasses each of these crucial steps. Objectives are as follows:Objective #1: Increase the number of Latinos in Dane County with a high school equivalency (GED). The benchmark for our GED program is 49 (70%) students will make progress toward passing the GED exam.Objective #2: Increase the number of Latinos who are proficient in English. The benchmark for our ESL program is 45 (75%) students will make progress toward completing an ESL level. Adequate progress for ESL students is defined as progressing toward completion of at least one level or advancing one ESL level within one year.Objective #3: Increase the number of adult Latino students with no prior elementary education who advance into the Pre-GED program. The benchmark for our Adult Basic Education program is 16 (80%) students will advance into Pre-GED classes.","Spanish GED: This program is organized into three semesters, meets twice weekly, and provides a supportive classroom environment. The curriculum is divided into sessions: Math-16 weeks, Reading/Language Arts-8 weeks, and Social Studies/Science-16 weeks. Students meet six hours per week for 40 weeks of classes. Students also meet for tutoring, case management, and workshops, and are expected to complete four hours of studying at home weekly. At the end of each semester, students take two practice tests and the official subject test.Pre-GED and Adult Basic Education: Students complete a placement test to determine which program they should enroll in. Both programs are designed for students who need to improve their reading, writing, and math skills. However, Adult Basic Education classes are typically for students who do not have any prior education. ESL: There are six ESL courses (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, or ESL for Technical Careers Intermediate/Advanced, and ESL for the Workplace). All courses meet 3 hours per week for 10-15 weeks. ESL for Technical Careers is offered in partnership with Madison College, and students are eligible for gaining college credits.

NRS is an outcome-based reporting system for state-administered, federally funded adult education programs. TABE CLAS-E testing results determine whether students advance to further levels of ESL instruction. Madison College conducts the TABE exam as the pre-GED and GED pre-test.

JCC utilizes current labor market data in the development of effective curricula pertinent to industry needs of the local workforce. Such data are also used in the development of structured pathways to guide student progression, completion, and success.","The high school dropout rate is 7.8%, based on 2017 data, but remains significant due to the accumulation of previous years. Census data indicates, of the 18 to 24 youth population, 21.8% have less than a high school diploma. For persons ages 25 plus, 4.8% of persons have less than 9th grade education and 9.1% have some high school, but no diploma. In 2017-18, 18% of the College's Basic Skills students had a 6th to 8th grade educational level and 53% had a 9th to 11th grade educational level.","The overall poverty average for North Carolina is 15.4% and 21.7% of children live in poverty. The 2017 US Census indicates the poverty rate for Johnston County is 13.2% with 19.2% of children, ages 0-17, living in poverty.

","According to the 2017 data from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, Johnston County, NC has a literacy level of 15%, which is below the national average of 18%. It is also important to note that the fastest growing group in Johnston County is the Hispanic population, now representing 13.1% of the total county population and 32% of the College's Basic Skills programs, as of the 2017-18 program year. This demographic often needs ELA instruction at varying educational levels.",,"The Career Ready project will serve 113 students through a three-tiered model of learning: contextualized, career infused ELA instruction; workforce preparation activities; and workforce/occupational training. Student progress will be evaluated in four areas: educational level gains on CASAS exams, HSE/AHS diploma attainment, postsecondary entrance and gainful employment. The expected outcome is 90 students will obtain at least one measureable skill gain (MSG) by program year-end. ","The comprehensive Career Ready program will be piloting an extension of services with labor market relevant career training through Integrated Education and Training (IET) to 113 students. They will participate in IET programs through layered preparation of stackable learning represented in a three-tiered model. IET training will be accessed through the college's 300 Ed2Go courses allowing students to individualize their occupational pathways, while exposing them to the pace and complexity of text and learning resources routinely encountered in postsecondary programs. Using this model, students earn stackable credentials in their fields of choice.The career fields of focus are based on the needs of the region as determined by the Capitol Area Workforce Development Board for the development of sustainable career pathways aligning with labor market demands and include the areas of IT, healthcare and skills trades (includes county specific areas of retail sales, construction and manufacturing). The Career Ready program is structured to provide contextualized English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Adult Basic Education (ABE), workforce preparation and workforce training in a concurrent instructional environment. Students are enrolled in their chosen online Ed2Go courses while they are attending ELA classes. Contextualized instruction also includes site visits and guest speakers to connect with persons representing a variety of career fields and opportunities. ","This pilot program is designed to provide an individualized approach towards expanding employment opportunities. Students will receive contextualized instruction focused on gaining English Language Acquisition skills (ELA) as well as Integrated Education and Training (IET). Project implementation will afford participants the opportunity to earn credentials, network in their chosen career pathway and advance within the workforce. Students entering the cohort without a high school diploma will also have the opportunity to prepare for and complete official High School Equivalency exams to obtain the HSE diploma.","ELA classes will be offered onsite, twice a week, for a total of 6 hours of weekly instruction, per student, each semester. Semesters run concurrently each program year- summer, fall and spring.For student convenience as well as a technology portion of instruction, Ed2go courses (five weeks in length) are offered monthly in an online asynchronous format. ELA classes are held at JCC's main campus in Smithfield. ELA classes will be scheduled during the day between 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. as well as an evening option between 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.Throughout the program year, student progress will be monitored and end of semester reporting will be generated. Students will have from July 1- June 30 to complete the ELA course, earn a certificate towards employability via the ed2go course option, and complete the HSE diploma, when applicable.","The college runs an open lab for all official Basic Skills placement testing and post-testing. Students can walk in at any time during the day or evening hours. The open lab ensures accurate marketing throughout the county and with our community referral partners. This approach for students has greatly improved our ability to streamline workflow, ensures Educational Function Level (EFL) gains are accomplished, and Measurable Skills Gains (MSG) targets are attained annually. Upon entrance to class, each student arrives with an initial placement report to assist the instructor with tracking performance and future post-testing needs. After each student post-tests, the teacher receives a score report and a note indicating if an EFL gain was achieved or if the student will need another post-test before the close of the current program year. This practice has proven very effective and efficient in assisting faculty, staff and students to meet annual MSG percentage targets, set at the beginning of each year. Ed2go certification/completions will be tracked through the colleges Colleague software reports.","Johnston Community College's main campus is located near the center of Johnston County, North Carolina in Smithfield.

The campus site includes scenic ponds, fountains, walking trails, thematic gardens, and courtyards through an array of native species plants and cultivated landscapes. For the scope of this project, Basic Skills has six dedicated classrooms in the Elsee Building on the college's main campus. Classrooms are equipped with up-to-date Smartboards, desktop computers and laptop carts. The college provides free Wi-Fi for students, as well as networked Internet access for instructional technologies. JCC is committed to selecting highly effective instructional materials and best practices that are research and evidence-based in support of student learning. Text materials and instructional resources utilized within classrooms are specific to adult learners and from publishers who are committed to providing high quality materials that are validated through andragogical research. Publishers utilized by the college include McGraw Hill, Pearson Vue, Cengage, Steck-Vaughn, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. ","Technology is fully integrated in classroom instruction. Wide varieties of devices are used to accomplish tasks related to content-based instruction. Programs integrate technology into reading and writing assignments, use video resources to enhance content and use mobile devices to improve writing skills by communication via email or text. To prepare students for college and career readiness, technology is frequently used in project-based approaches in which students use tools to locate information, conduct research, create and share presentations with one another, and provide feedback. Faculty utilize 12 interactive Smartboards, purchased in 2017, as a routine teaching tool along with 5 desktop computers (purchased in 2019) located in all on-campus instructional classrooms. Two laptop carts are available for checkout, either as classroom sets, or individually, to accommodate specific instructional needs. These Dell laptops (24) were purchased in 2014 and are updated annually by the college's IT department. With the laptop carts, we can ensure that all students in a classroom have equal access to technology during instructional time. Access to resources is also available through the college's Learning Resource Center (LRC) where faculty and students may check out new computers, video recorders, webcams, and wireless headsets. From the LRC webpage, students may connect to more than 50 electronic resources to support their learning both in the classroom and beyond.

(Health Education for You!), K-Club (Family Literacy) pilot program focusing on kindergarten transition, Citizenship Class*	Establish a second PLEAS (Parents Learning English At School) site with new partner New Castle County Head Start at the Absalom Jones Community Center*	Reducing our learner waiting list by serving 50 new learners *	Increasing the number of learners served to 230 *	Updating our adult literacy curriculum *	195 learners in the program meet at least 2 selected goals*	162 learners increase their scores on the standardized assessments we use","In order to achieve these objectives, we need to rebuild our infrastructure to support an increase in capacity.  One way to do this is to develop a volunteer network to assist with tutor training, recruitment, registration and orientation to enhance our ability to serve learners throughout the state.  Two additional part time staff members are also needed to help monitor and manage these additional tutors, learners, and programs.  Another part of rebuilding and enhancing our infrastructure to support increased capacity is to establish a program committee tasked with helping with outreach and assisting in developing new partnerships with other organizations.  Leveraging our resources and partnering with other organizations allows us to develop and support new impactful programs more efficiently.  This committee will be instrumental in developing the financial and human capital needed to rebuild the infrastructure and expand our capacity.  Additional learners in the program will also require additional curriculum resources.  The most updated adult literacy curriculum available is comprised of more current themes, research-based methods and activities, and offers expanded technological resources.  We specifically decided to not apply for federal funding in order to serve those most in need who do not fit with the government's outcomes.","The timeline includes activities and plans already underway.

The project will deliver research based practices and curriculum to increase reading and  writing skills over the course of the class. At the completion of year 1 this project will donate 25 new titles to the Turner Public Library for its biography collection. Titles will be selected by  students based on research, personal interest and culturally meaningful stories.Titles will also  include literature from and about different countries and cultures and strengthen the library's community presence with students.This new inventory will engage students to frequent the library at higher rates as measured by a survey evaluating current use vs 6 months later. This project will also deliver new technology skills to students via the Maine State Library online access. Other components include a weekly field trip to the local library, use of the  dewey decimal system to find and check out books and multimedia, create a targeted reading group using library materials, attendance at a local library authors event, and create a book ""Stories of our Lives"" based on the writings and history of the students. The project will culminate in a visit to the Maine State Library. ","Libraries & Literacy will be presented in two sessions, Fall and Spring. Each of the sessions will encompass 15 weeks of student contact consisting of 6 weekly contact hours, and 2 hours of weekly independent reading. The classroom program will consist of 2 major components, library and classroom instruction. Library instruction will involve a weekly visit to the  Turner library where, with library assistance, students will learn the benefits and uses of public libraries. Initially each student will be registered with a library card.  Next students will  learn how to find and access relevant on site texts: books, magazines, newspapers and multimedia including ebooks and audiobooks. Students will also explore the technology of the Maine state library system to discover materials not available locally. Finally, students will research relevant books to donate to the library that explore heritage and culture. Classroom instruction will focus on guided critical reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of readings focused on helping them uncover and share their own stories.They will explore tools for more effective reading and writing, and they will use these tools in the compilation of their autobiographies.

While this number is lower than the national average, it does not reflect the larger issue of underemployment for many residents of our community. Many refugees and immigrants are highly skilled or have higher education from another country, but lack the English proficiency or certification necessary to pursue a career in the U.S. We help them acquire the literacy skills they need in order to improve their employment options.  ",The drop-out rate for Grand Island Public Schools is 0.35% for the 2017-2018 school year.,"The median family income in Grand Island is 17% lower than the national average (Grand Island--$49,118Í¾ U.S.--$59,039).  Survey data indicates that 98.3% of our students report income below the median family income threshold. Additionally, the poverty rate for Grand Island is higher than the national average (Grand Island--16.4%Í¾ U.S.-- 14.8%). As many as 70% of our public school students are eligible for free and reduced meals, much higher than the state average of 46%.  ","Over 15% of Grand Island residents are categorized as having Limited English Proficiency (source: American Community Survey). Similarly, 17% of Grand Island Public School students qualify for ESL/ELL services, compared to the statewide average of 10%.  American Community Survey data from 2017 indicates that 25% of our population speaks a language other than English at home. This is reflected in the rapid recent growth of our program from 93 students to more than 675 in the past 5 years.",,"Adult Literacy and ESL Instruction will be provided at no cost to 675 adults in 2019. Students will have access to instruction via our four pillars of programming: Group Classes, One-on-One Tutoring, Language and Learning Lab, and Community Connection Center. Access to these services will result in increased literacy skills, demonstrated by student surveys. Ultimately, increased literacy skills will help students take steps towards higher education, improved employment, and economic stability. ","In 2019, we anticipate the following overall programming results:-675 individuals will have access to instructional services-190 students will meet one-on-one with a tutor-700 hours of group class instruction will be offered-6 community events will be offered-100 individuals will receive services in the Community Connection Center's educational spaceThis data will be recorded by attendance logs, maintained in our Access database, and reviewed regularly by staff and the Board of Directors.For our adult literacy students, the primary outcome will be increased English proficiency. We anticipate that increased English proficiency will be self-reported by at least 75% of survey respondents during our annual student survey to evaluate student progress. We will also track long-term benchmark goals in the areas of education, employment, self-sufficiency, and community integration.The impact of our programming is evident in the lives of our students. Zakaryah, a refugee from Sudan, has been extremely self-motivated, working at his job through the night, studying English during the day, sleeping for a few hours, and starting over. With hard work and the help of his tutor, he passed the U.S. citizenship test, passed the test to acquire his CDL license, and attained a trucking job, all within the past several months. His hard work combined with the support and education he is receiving at LCofGI is helping him to achieve his goals and integrate into our community.","LCofGI helps our adult learners increase their literacy skills through 4 pillars of programming:1. In One-on-One Tutoring, students meet individually with a trained volunteer tutor for weekly instruction. While most focus on English literacy, tutors tailor instruction to each student's unique goals, from studying for citizenship or GED tests to preparing for a job interview or medical appointment. The personal connections that result provide a tremendous benefit for the student, and create valuable cross-cultural connections within our diverse community.2. In our Language and Learning Lab, students are trained and guided through digital coursework, increasing their digital literacy. While most students are studying English literacy, we now offer Career Discoveries and citizenship exam preparation.3. In Group Class Instruction, teachers provide literacy instruction in a group setting at a variety of times and instructional levels. 13 group classes are currently meeting weekly. Classes focus on English literacy, citizenship, health literacy, and foundations of financial literacy.4. In our Community Connection Center, we host educational events, provide drop-in assistance for students, and offer an informal gathering place. These are designed to bring people of our community together to connect and learn.Each one of our students has unique goals. This multifaceted approach has proven to be an effective way for students to progress in their English language skills.","Our adult literacy programming will continue to be offered on an ongoing basis. New students join our program daily: we are the only local organization to offer a streamlined intake process that allows students to begin English study right away, rather than waiting for the start of a new semester. A new student walking in off the street can be registered, assessed, trained, and begin instruction within an hour..Opportunities are abundant for students to receive instruction in a variety of ways. Most tutors and students meet for 1-2 hours each week. Our Language and Learning Lab is open during office hours (M-W 9 a.m.-5 p.m. and Thursday 9 a.m.- 8 p.m.) with 15 computers available. Several of our computer-based language programs are now also accessible via home computers and mobile phones. 13 group classes (1-1.5 hour each) are offered at various times throughout the week, and students are permitted to attend any class according to their level and interest. With additional tutoring help available on Fridays via a collaboration with a local high school, and with group classes offered on Saturdays and Sundays, services are now available to students 7 days a week.","While the Literacy Council highly values the quantitative results provided by standardized testing such as TABE, CASAS, and BEST, we do not have sufficient funds to implement them. At this time, we employ a cost-effective accommodation based on our literacy curriculum to conduct initial student assessment and placement.  Beyond that, we are in the process of implementing annual student surveys.  Survey questions will assess students' English proficiency and achievements.  Students will self-report progress on topics such as ability to write name, ability to complete a form with basic biographical information, ability to complete a job application, ability to write a resume, ability to help children with homework, ability to talk with a stranger (grocery clerk, cashier, bank teller, etc.), ability to talk with authority figures (boss, doctor, children's teachers), etc. Students will also be asked to identify benchmark achievements, such as new job or promotion, pay increase, passing U.S. citizenship exam, receiving job certification, etc. We consider it a future goal to attain support and staffing so that standardized assessments can be conducted in the future.","Our office is intentionally located near where a majority of our students live in order to accommodate many that do not have access to reliable transportation.

Out of 25 students who are refugees, 100% will improve English literacy levels. 10 will eventually enroll in community college, within a year of completion of the MAC program.10 will pursue further training in career and technical education programs available to them at OACES, such as printing and promotions which will utilize improved digital literacy made possible through their time in the MAC Academy. 5 students will obtain their high school equivalency (GED) within a year of enrolling in the program.","When youth refugees arrive to Rochester, they often come either alone or with family members that they must support. Youth refugees arrive with limited English, limited cultural understanding, and limited understanding of logistical, everyday realities such as health insurance and finances. These realities create economic and social insecurity, which the Making a Connection (MAC) Academy addresses through workforce preparation, health and financial literacy training, and driving lessons. Field trip opportunities provide community engagement and cultural assimilation, and a support system, which past students have referred to as ""family."" Overall, the program is comprised of academic coursework at OACES and cultural education through volunteer and field trip opportunities in the Rochester area. After meeting with MAC Academy staff to determine a student's needs and goals, and after testing to determine English and adult basic education levels, MAC students begin their English literacy and educational pursuits at OACES. The MAC Academy is structured around the Rochester City School District calendar, with daily literacy instruction and weekly cultural field trips and events. An annual highlight is a tour of Washington, D.C. to support social, political, cultural, and linguistic literacy.The MAC Academy has delivered tangible results for students: alumni are enrolled at Monroe Community College, employed in technical careers, pursuing home ownership, and more.","The Making a Connection Academy program at OACES----and all other programs at OACES--follow the Rochester City School District calendar. This means that students are in educational and trade skills classes from 9am-3:30pm Monday through Friday, though there is a part-time option for just morning or just afternoon instruction. There is also the option for evening and night classes. This funding will support the Making a Connection Academy's programmatic costs for the duration of one school year (August 2019-June 2020). Each student does typically receive 30 hours of instruction weekly.","All students at OACES are TABE and BEST plus tested once a month. This includes  MAC students, and will continue to include MAC students in the future. English literacy teachers and trade skills teachers frequently administer their own tests and assessments, and MAC staff will review students' performances on these tests as indicators of students' progress. The MAC Academy also utilizes students' feedback as a means of self-evaluation and administers surveys to learn how students perceive their own English, math, digital, and overall literacy levels.","The MAC Academy program is located at the Office of Adult and Career Education Services, which is furnished with modern classrooms featuring computers and SmartBoards. The facility includes a computer lab for students to improve digital literacy.

The population being served are low literate adults and immigrants that are English Language Learners. Other adults may have low reading and writing skills that keeps them from being successful in finding employment. This is the population we serve throughout Lakeland, Bartow and Mulberry communities.","The dropout rate for Florida is 4.0 percent for the 2017 school year. The rate is a 0.2 percent higher than the previous year of 3.8 percent. This is why adult literacy is so important to the future of many dropouts. For various reasons, dropouts find that an education is important to their future productivity and economic stability. READ Lakeland is here to assist in their educational endeavors.","The poverty level for Polk County Florida is 16.6 percent. Although we are in the largest municipality, Lakeland, the other geographic areas are mostly rural and small communities where poverty is prevalent. Those areas have significantly low-income levels and less than high school education levels.  ","The low literacy rate for the Polk County area is 20 -27 percent, according to the Florida Literacy Coalition. Polk County includes the cities of Lakeland, Bartow and Mulberry. The low literacy rate is a concern for the citizens of the areas we serve.",,"The number of individuals served will be 25 in the Lakeland, Mulberry and Bartow communities. We expect to offer literacy services that will increase the adult learners' literacy skills, if they stay with the program at least 6 months. Instruction will include, success skills (how to study, taking notes, how to test) reading, writing, math, and English language. The impact on the communities will build the opportunity for further education and economic stability to disenfranchised adults.","The program objective of SSS, is to reach out to the Lakeland area and to include the cities of Bartow and Mulberry. Bartow and Mulberry areas, as we have in the last three grant cycles, providing literacy services to individuals that are low literate, returning to school and who wish to learn the English language. The services we provide are reading, writing, math, English and conversation skills. The goal is to provide additional assistance to the greater Lakeland area to increase the literacy rate. We often have volunteer tutors from those areas who would prefer to tutor closer to home. There are individuals in need that would benefit from our program who live in outlying areas. In the geographic area, we expect to enroll 25 students over the year (including ongoing students) and 15 active students will be tutored at any given time during the program year. Our target number of students registered during the year is 25. After 30 hours of tutoring or six months of active participation, a minimum of 14 students will have made a grade level gain and met at least one goal they set when they entered the program.  ","The design of SSS project/program is to serve the greater Lakeland community including Bartow and Mulberry areas for individuals in need of adult literacy services. READ Lakeland will create advertising materials to be distributed to the local libraries, churches and other organizations that may serve a similar population. We will recruit students and volunteer tutors. Trained tutors from all areas will have the opportunity to request where they would like to tutor and then students will be matched with an appropriate tutor. Tutors are required to have a background check before they tutor. Tutor training is provided by READ Lakeland, Inc. as needed, usually three times each year. Tutoring materials will be ordered from the New Reader's Press (workbooks, teacher editions, reading for pleasure books, etc.).  As we receive feedback from students interested in tutoring services, the Program Coordinator will enroll them in the READ Lakeland database and then schedule the student for an assessment. The Program Coordinator, administers the reading, ESL, math or writing assessment at a scheduled date and time in the community library of the adult learner. The learner is then assigned a tutor that will best match his/her needs. We will refer to other community services and schools for GED testing and services we do not provide.Tutor reports are due by the fifth of each month. The reports are designed to capture key information for grant reporting. ","The Skills for Student Success project duration will be eleven months from May 2019 through April 2020.

As needed, visit Bartow and Mulberry to oversee the tutoring process and discuss any issues, assess students, enter monthly reports from the tutors into the data system and reassess students as needed.  If the available tutor levels fall, we will complete another tutor training. Monthly reports will identify any issues that come up with the tutor or student and adjustments will be made if needed. The program coordinator will complete the documentation and reporting as required by Dollar General Literacy Foundation.","Each student that enrolls in the Skills for Student Success project is given an initial assessment in the literacy area in which tutoring is requested. READ Lakeland, Inc. uses the Laubach Reading Evaluation Adult Diagnosis (READ) assessment for reading levels and the English as a Second Language Oral Assessment (ESLOA) for ESOL adult learners from New Reader's Press, a division of Pro Literacy Worldwide. For Math assessments, we use the Breakthrough to Math locator and placement inventory from New Reader's Press. The scores are aligned with Grade Level Equivalent (GLE) used by the Test for Adult Basic Education. The same assessment is given after 30 hours or when the tutor deems necessary. Since our adult learners have many family, economic and life skill responsibilities, the established number of hours is easier to track than number of sessions.  The tutor monthly reporting forms are designed to track tutoring hours, books, goal setting, why they dropped from the program and progress in GLE. The information is recorded in our database, Matrix, that will prompt needed reports. The total project will be assessed through student, tutor and library feedback along with the number of tutors trained, number of student enrollments and length of time in the program: all tracked through the Matrix database.","The libraries in Lakeland (3) Bartow and Mulberry have adequate facilities for one-on-one tutoring for our tutors and students. The program coordinator will keep the materials available in Lakeland for all locations. Training space for tutor training is available and adequate in all libraries. READ Lakeland will promote the literacy services through brochures, flyers and other paraphernalia that gives information about the expansion for the SSS program and how to reach us. The promotional materials will be located at the libraries, stores, churches, government agencies and promoted through the media.

Measurable outcomes for this population are defined above, in the statement of impact.","Not everyone can read this sentence.According to the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities, 1 out of every 5 children in the U.S. has a diagnosed learning disability, such as dyslexia.  Diagnosis is a costly and extensive process which is not offered by NY public schools.  As such, countless undiagnosed children with LD fail to keep up with their peers despite their best efforts.  35% of children with LD drop out of high school.  Of those who do graduate, less than 2% attend a four year college, despite the fact that many are above average in intelligence (Source: National Longitudinal Transition Study).  A report from the Schwab Company shares further disturbing statistics: Previously undetected learning disabilities have been found in 50% of juvenile delinquents, and 30% of adolescents with LD will be arrested 3-5 years out of high school.  As they age, 43% of LD adults live at or below the poverty level and 48% are out of the workforce or unemployed (Source: Bridges to Practice). This is a preventable problem.  By teaching dyslexic adults how to read, we can open doors of opportunity including meaningful employment, higher education, and more.  Literacy Nassau works with volunteer tutors to deliver 1:1 and small group tutoring for adults with the lowest levels of literacy.  In this program, we will recruit no less than 15 tutors who will be trained to deliver Orton-Gillingham based instruction to 32 dyslexic adults from our wait list.","The program will begin on July 1, 2019 and will run until June 30, 2020.  Literacy Nassau staff members will train 15 volunteer tutors in a curriculum called ""The ABCs of OG,"" from Multisensory Learning Associates.

They will meet in libraries across Nassau County for no less than 2 hours per week (twice per week, one hour per session).  There is potential for each student to receive up to 100 hours of instruction through this project, but realistically, we define success as achieving 50 hours of instruction.","As described above, we will utilize the Gallistel Ellis Test of Coding Skills, along with the TABE 11/12 Level L (Reading only).  Both tests will be given at the start of the program in July 2019 and will be re-administered at the conclusion of the program in June 2020.","As stated above, the facilities utilized for this project will be public libraries across Nassau County.  Tutors will each be given a copy of The ABCs of OG by Multisensory Learning Associates and will have access to our library of resources for supplemental worksheets, handouts, and more.  ","Technology is not necessary to teach dyslexic adults to read.  In fact, we are against using technology for this purpose because it limits the multi-sensory experience for the student.  Students need to engage all pathways to learning (visual, auditory, kinesthetic and tactile) simultaneously in order for Orton Gillingham instruction to work.  We use old fashioned methods to accomplish this: we teach cursive handwriting (because there are no reversals in lowercase cursive), use paper and pencil for writing, read from actual books made of paper (not e-books or computer screens, which complicate the dyslexic reader's ability for tracking while reading), and use chalkboards and whiteboards.

","According to the KY Department of Education Office of Assessment and Accountability, the dropout rate for the Metcalfe County School System continues to hold at 0.5%. ","The Census Bureau reported in 2017 that 23.4% of the Metcalfe County population was living at or below poverty level, with a Median household income of $35,594. ","The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 18% of the Metcalfe population lacks prose literacy skills. The Census Bureau reports that 24% of the Metcalfe population over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma, or its equivalent. That number represents a significant percentage of the county's working age population who are often unemployable, employable in unskilled positions, or deficient in job skills dues to a lack of literacy and educational skills.  ",,"A new Program Coordinator was added in the 2017-18 fiscal year to scope out and reassess the educational/career needs for the Metcalfe County. In that assessment it was noted that a focus needs to be made to reengage those who lack a high school diploma; provide an avenue for career skill-based training; and to provide English literacy skills to its ESL population.  MCSU strives to better educate the community, and transition them into careers where they can sustain a wage above poverty level.","As referenced above, 24% of the county population, age 25 and older, lack a high school equivalency diploma. In addition, 23.4% of the population live below poverty level. It is a measurable goal to reengage those who previously did not finish high school, dropped out of the GED program, and newly engage recent high school dropouts. Financial assistance for GED testing is also a need. The current GED goal for Metcalfe County is 16 per fiscal year. Additional financial assistance is needed to promote and engage student interest outside the areas allowed by the program's core grant. In addition, MCSU has seen interest in ELA/ESL classes via community requests and the local Migrant Program. In order to adequately provide both ABE/GED and ESL services, MCSU needs additional funding to supplement instructors' salaries; funding for the ESL program (testing materials, marketing, materials, and computer software); and promotional funds to successfully market the program. Objectives: 1) Provide/supplement an ESL instructor salary; 2) Increase program enrollment by adding an ESL class; 3) adequately market and promote program services; and 4) Reach the GED annual goal.   ","Additional funding will allow MCSU to employ a part-time instructor for 48 weeks in the 2019-20 fiscal year (July 1, 2019 -- June 30, 2020). MCSU is currently open 8-hours a day Monday and Tuesday, and 4-hours on Wednesday, or 20-hours weekly. Adding an ESL class, will mandate an instructor for that content area. With the addition of the ESL program, projected enrollment is expected to increase by a minimum of 10 -25 people, annually. There are no other ELA/ESL programs in the county for adults and this would allow MCSU to meet an ever-growing county need, wherein MCSU can provide educational and career opportunities to this minority population. There is currently a Mexican owned restaurant, a Chinese owned restaurant, and a Japanese run factory located in Metcalfe County. In addition, there are several migrant farm families that live in the county needing ESL services. The Program Coordinator (PC) is currently the only full-time staff at MCSU and in her full-time capacity, splits her time 50/50 between two county Skills U programs. A part-time instructor would be necessary to adequately implement the ESL program. In addition, these funds would allow MCSU to appropriate funds to marketing strategies, including, but not limited to, newspaper ads, radio spots, tangible promotional materials, and social media posts. In addition, the funding would supplement GED Test fees for students unable to pay.  ","MCSU runs on a fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). Contingent on Dollar General grant funding, it would be the goal to have the ESL program implemented and reaching its intended goals within the 2019-20 fiscal year. A part-time ESL instructor would need to be hired. Program and testing materials would need to be purchased and online installations made, as needed. Marketing for the ESL program would happen at the onset of the fiscal year. With those things in place, MCSU would hope to have the new ESL program fully operational by late September, 2019.  Funding would also be used throughout the fiscal year for promotional activities to retain current students (both ABE/GED & ESL) and reach out to engage new and/or current students. Supplemental GED test funds would be expended on an ""as needed"" basis to supplement (or completely pay) for student GED test fees for those who are otherwise unable to pay due to an undue financial hardship. The test fee is currently $120 for the entire GED test, or $30 per test module (4 modules per test). GED test payments from the KYSU core grant is not an allowable expense, so GED-ready students are often unable to finish due to financial hardships.  ","Formal and informal assessment methods will be used to monitor student and program progress during the fiscal year. Formal assessment methods will include TABE, CASAS, and GED Ready testing. Formal program assessment is performed monthly at the state level and monitored, accordingly. TABE and CASAS testing will be assessed to track student progress and NRS (National Reporting Service) level gains at 30-40 hours of instruction. The GED Ready Test (Official Practice Test) will be administered to students who show they are near test ready, to ascertain specific areas of GED instruction still needed to pass the official GED test, if any, whereby using it as a diagnostic tool as well as a tool to modify instruction. Informal assessment will be done by Administrators (Director, Coordinator and Instructors) on a weekly basis monitoring student progress through observation, verbal interaction with students, gauging student responses, and application of learned material(s). Informal program monitoring will be done by observation, community engagement, program enrollment and retention, and overall student involvement. The Program Coordinator and instructor will meet weekly to discuss student achievement/progress, assess program effectiveness, and collaborate to develop strategies for improvement in identified areas. In addition, collected data input into the state data system (KAERS) will generate performance reports to assist tracking student enrollment and academic level gains. ","The Metcalfe County ""Skills U"" Program rents a stand-alone facility/building to house the program. The building contains approximately 1,200 square feet of space and consists of an office for the Program Coordinator, restroom facilities, one classroom, and one computer lab. The maximum capacity for the classroom is 20 students and the maximum capacity of the computer lab is 12 students. Physical space is more than adequate to implement the project and MCSU receives IT support from Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College (SKYCTC).","Sixteen desktop computers, two laptop computers, two fixed projectors, one portable projector and two interactive (smart) boards are currently available and utilized during direct instruction at the Metcalfe County ""Skills U' Center.

The software will support students' programs of study. Often students use lab time who cannot make it to the scheduled classes. The requested software aligns directly with the TABE, CASAS, GED Ready, GED, and NCRC and also teaches the basic computer functions necessary for the GED Test. The software will allow students to complete their goals in a timely manner. The primary objective of the BCAE Continuing Student Access and Success project is to provide BCAE students with the software necessary to study for and obtain their GED certificates.

The average annual income is approximately $15,874 and even lower ($11,665) for seniors and special needs residents living on fixed incomes.","The Governor's Office of Student Achievement says the percent of students reading at proficient-level or higher in 3rd grade is 29% in for the DeKalb County School District and 30% for Chatham County Schools, compared to 37% statewide. This is important because after 3rd grade, students must know how to read to understand other subjects; 3rd grade reading is an indicator of high school literacy; and low literacy students are more likely to have behavioral problems and higher grade retention.",,"Economic Mobility and Stability programs are available to 895 low-income families at MHSE properties in metro Atlanta and Savannah. Participants receive GED prep instruction and testing facilitation from certified teachers; beginner-level adult literacy curriculum; and assistance with job searching, rÃ©sumÃ© writing, job applications, and other supports. The expected outcomes are to improve educational attainment, employment outcomes and financial self-sufficiency among residents of our housing.","GED prep: Financial stability for our residents is one of our highest priorities. Many entry-level jobs require at least a high school diploma. As a result of the GED prep course, residents will earn this important credential making them more qualified jobseekers. They will be better positioned to acquire sustainable employment and earn a livable wage to support their families.The measurable outcomes of GED prep are:*	The 29 residents currently enrolled remain in the program.*	At least 5-7 students complete the program within the year, while all others plan to remain engaged until they complete the program.*	At least 2-4 pass all exam sections to earn their high school equivalency during the year.The goal of adult literacy is to increase reading comprehension and writing skills for residents wishing to pursue a GED and/or stable employment. Oftentimes, adults who struggle with literacy feel embarrassed or ashamed about coming forward to seek help. Our objective is for 1-3 residents per year to utilize the curriculum made available on-site.Job-readiness assistance is provided one-on-one to residents seeking employment or better paying jobs. Our objective is for at least 10 residents to take advantage of this offering. Ultimately, we expect job-readiness to result in higher employment rates, increased wages and improved job performance as residents become more skilled employees in the workforce.","Recognizing the need to improve education and financial outcomes for our underserved population, in 2016 MHSE began offering GED prep to our family housing residents in Savannah. In 2017, the program expanded to metro Atlanta and has since nearly tripled in size. GED prep empowers adults on our properties to earn a high school equivalency, transition into stable, better paying jobs, and achieve financial independence. Classes consist of instruction to prepare adults for the General Equivalency Diploma, consisting of four sections: reading/writing, social studies, science and math. Programming is open to residents of our two metro Atlanta family properties and takes place at our 406-unit Hills at Fairington community in Lithonia. Residents of our 90-unit Terraces at Parkview property (1.5 miles away) also participate. In Savannah, the program is conducted at our Savannah Gardens property, home to 399 families in Savannah's Eastside. Adult literacy and job-readiness take place on a case-by-case basis. Residents who struggle with literacy often feel stigmatized and hesitate to ask for help. Those seeking support can reach out to Resident Services staff who provide one-on-one instruction utilizing certified reading curriculum available on-site. Those in need of job-readiness support receive assistance identifying and applying for jobs. This includes assistance with rÃ©sumÃ©s and applications, interview skills, job postings, computer literacy, and other consultation as needed.","The GED prep course coincides with the DeKalb County School System and Savannah-Chatham County School calendars, from August to May. For our metro Atlanta residents, classes take place on Saturdays from 10 to 1 at the Hills at Fairington (three hours per week per student). GED prep classes at Savannah Gardens are held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:30 to 4:30 (four hours per week per student). Students work at their own pace and can complete any number of exam sections over the course of the year, picking up where they left off in subsequent years.One of our goals for 2019 is to increase participation in the program. To make classes more accessible, we are researching alternative technology, such as using Skype webinars or Blackboard (a web-based program that allows students to remotely receive instruction, submit assignments, complete assessments, etc.) to deliver the classes. We are also considering varying the class times to reach a wider audience.Adult literacy and job-readiness take place on a case-by-case basis. Some residents who want to pursue a GED find they do not have the literacy skills needed to begin the GED prep program. Resident Services staff are available to work with them one-on-one until they reach their literacy goals. Similarly, staff work with residents on job-readiness until they find employment or no longer need assistance. This can take anywhere from one week to one month depending on their personal needs, followed by regular follow-ups.","Mercy Housing incorporates evidence-based best practices in our program measurement and evaluation. We are committed to measuring the impact of our work and have made significant investments in infrastructure to accomplish that end. To measure program success, we observe and analyze the outcomes that result from service utilization. Our Mercy Measures software enables us to evaluate Resident Services activities and results. On-site staff input data into Mercy Measures to track attributes like program participation, income, and educational outcomes. We also conduct an annual resident survey at all of our properties. The survey compares residents across Mercy Housing regions, properties, program models, age groups, gender, and among the general population. Our program evaluation team performs an in-depth analysis of the survey results allowing us to observe trends and identify needs in our area. In metro Atlanta, each GED prep participant takes the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) before starting the course. The GED practice tests are considered the post-tests for the program, followed by the GED exam for each of the four sections. In Savannah, instructors from Royce Learning Center provide a pre-test, weekly progress reports, and practice tests throughout the year for each student.","The program at the Hills at Fairington and Savannah Gardens takes place within the leasing offices, each of which contains a designated community room, multi-purpose rooms, and classroom settings appropriate for program delivery. The leasing office is centrally located within the housing community allowing for high visibility to the residents. Resident Services staff display program information and updates on bulletin boards in the leasing office, and staff are stationed in the office to answer any questions. By design, the community rooms are adaptable to fit the needs of a variety of programs. Economic Mobility and Stability programs take place in large classroom settings with desks, a smart TV, and classroom supplies, such as paper, pencils, notebooks, etc. The leasing offices are also equipped with a computer lab adjacent to the community room in which residents can access the internet and basic software applications.Accessibility notice: All MHSE property units, common areas, facilities and services are readily-accessible to and usable by disabled persons. Our developments comply with Georgia Department of Community Affairs accessibility requirements and all applicable Federal and State accessibility laws. ","The Hills at Fairington in Lithonia is supplied with five computers (each around ten years old), a smart TV, and calculators. There are three computers in the computer lab at Savannah Gardens that are in the process of being repaired and may have to be replaced. This equates to a twelve to five student to computer ratio at Hills at Fairington, and currently a 17 to zero ratio at Savannah Gardens.",Yes,"To add an option for students to attend GED prep classes virtually via Skype, we would need to purchase a video camera with recording capabilities. This technology would allow residents who do not live directly on the host properties to participate in classes from their own housing communities, rather than traveling off-site. It would also be a cost-effective way to maximize the number of students served by one instructor. The addition of new laptop computers would allow students to complete assignments, practice tests and evaluations electronically, and run Blackboard to participate in GED prep remotely. Upgraded computers also provide access to online reading materials and interactive reading programs for those participating in adult literacy.We are also in need of LCD interactive whiteboards for the Hills at Fairington, Terraces at Parkview, and Savannah Gardens properties.

The program provides an individualized learning environment for adult learners wishing to enhance literacy skills and/or GED preparation. Each learner works with a certified teacher to create an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and establish individualized goals. The ACE program sees 100-150 students pass through the program each semester. With three semesters offered, approximately 300-450 students are served each year.","The target population for the ACE program are adults from the age of 16 and up. Classes are open to anyone with a self-identification of need, low basic skill development, and a desire to improve their skills and further their education. Basic literary skill levels of the learners range from totally illiterate to functionally literate; most of our learners function at a 6th grade level or less. The goal of the ACE Program is to ensure adults in Savannah have access to affordable education and learning opportunities. The Literacy Foundation notes illiterate individuals usually receive less income, lower quality jobs, and reduced access to lifelong learning and professional development, putting them in an unstable situation and often leading to intergenerational illiteracy. We believe literacy is critical to economic development and individual and community well-being, and want to remove any economic barrier facing adults wanting to receive educational services. ACE provides an individualized learning environment for adult learners of various ages and abilities. We assist learners in enhancing literacy, and in preparing for several tests and exams including the GED. In 2018, using results from the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) and GED subject matter tests, 20 individuals received their GED, 50 demonstrated progress in GED subject areas, and 321 individuals achieved their education goals.","The ACE program provides an individualized learning environment for learners of various abilities, from enhancing literacy and language skills to preparation for GED/college, or to gain/better employment opportunities through workplace tests such as Commercial Drivers License (CDL), Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Test (ASVAB), and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).Upon entrance to the ACE program, adult learners are given the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine current academic functioning and explore areas of strengths and weaknesses. Learners work with a certified lead teacher to create an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) targeting needed skills for identified goals. The learner is also paired with a skilled volunteer to work one-to-one towards meeting the objectives outlined in the IEP. Learners are retested every 60 hours to assess progress towards stated goals and readiness for exams such as the GED.This individualized approach better assists each learner to achieve his/her desired goals and can often be the stepping-stone needed for education and career development, improved job opportunities, and more economic independence.","Currently five classes are offered throughout the year with fall, spring, and summer semester sessions available with morning, evening, and Saturday hours to accommodate varying schedules:Morning classes are offered Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am - 11am,Evening classes are offered Monday thru Thursday 5pm - 7pm, and Saturday classes are offered each week from 9am - 1pm.Classes are also offered at our satellite location, Wesley Community Centers of Savannah, on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 5p - 7p.Spring and Fall classes are 15 weeks in length and provide  approximately 60 hours of specialized instruction.Summer classes are eight weeks in length and provide approximately 30 hours of specialized instruction.The amount of weekly instructional hours varies by student as some students attend classes once a week, while others attend four or five days a week.Each class provides a capacity of 75 ""seats"" per year.Learners are accepted on a rolling basis and may remain enrolled as long as needed to meet academic goals, but must exhibit a commitment to learning through regular attendance and participation.Length of participation varies greatly; some students have participated for years, while others enroll for very specific short-term goals, such as studying to pass work related certification programs, or sections of the GED. ","For Adult Basic Education (ABE) learners the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) is used to pre-test and post-test after every 60 hours of instruction to determine growth and progress toward specific academic goals. TABE remains the most comprehensive and reliable academic assessment product in adult basic education. Educators use TABE testing to provide a solid foundation for effectively assessing the skills and knowledge of adult learners. TABE and TABE CLAS-E tests combine to provide a flexible system of diagnostic assessments and instruction materials to meet the diverse needs of today's growing adult education market. For GED students, practice tests are used to determine weakness within subject matter that can then be addressed. Once students demonstrate proficiency and the ability to pass practice tests consistently, they register to take the actual GED.The Technical College System of Georgia will only allow individuals to take the GED test at Technical College locations. Learners are asked to submit their results to us.Progress for the GED is measured utilizing the actual GED subject test areas. Students share test results of each practice section as they are taken. When adult learners show consistent ability to pass practice tests in each subject area, they will register to take that particular area of the test. If successful, they will then move on to the next subject matter content area. Subject area test results will verify data.","The Royce Learning Center campus accommodates Chatham Academy, a day school for students with Learning Disabilities, The Royce Collegiate Institute, The Tutoring Center and Summer School/Enrichment Camp, Summer Programs, and the Adult & Community Education (ACE) Program.Royce's main campus is located in mid-town Savannah and is on the Chatham Area Transit bus route.

A supplemental three-credit College and Career Success class helps students develop the characteristics, habits and attitudes of an effective learner. One hour of weekly tutoring is required. ","The Success First Intensive English program consists of 14 credit hours and runs from 9 to 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9 to 11:50 a.m. Mondays and Wednesdays. Intensive English students are considered full-time students and are not allowed to take any other classes. Intensive English students are also required to participate in two hours of 2:1 tutoring with a certified ESL tutor each week. Success First Reading and Writing consists of 12 credit hours and meets from 9 to 11:50 a.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, from 9:30 to 11:45 a.m. on Tuesdays and from 9:30 to 10:45 a.m. on Thursdays. Reading and Writing students are considered full-time students but may enroll in a math class in the afternoons with the approval of their instructor. Reading and Writing students are required to participate in one hour of mandatory tutoring each week. ","Donnelly has a well-established assessment system for evaluating all of its academic programs, including Success First. Standard indicators used to measure student achievement include attendance records, test scores, course grades, in-class assessments, and semester and cumulative grade point averages (GPAs).  Additional indicators used to measure overall program effectiveness include number and percent of students achieving target outcomes--English language fluency, proficiency in oral and written communication and college readiness. Because the goal of the Success First program is to prepare students to be successful in college-level classes, we also track students' subsequent performance in Composition I and II, Freshman Seminar and First Year Experience. Finally, we track the percentage of Donnelly graduates who completed their degree program after beginning their college journeys in Success First. At the end of each academic year, the Success First Program Director uses student achievement data to complete a formal program assessment report that is shared with college leadership. Every three years, the Success First program undergoes a comprehensive Program Review.

However, neighborhood unemployment rates provide only a partial picture of the economic challenges within LEC's zone. Over 6 out of every 10 households in LEC's neighborhoods earn less than $35,000 per year (a rate that is 87% higher than the rest of Greenville County).","The most recently reported Greenville County high school dropout rate stood at 2.8% (for the 2016-2017 academic year). LEC's dropout rate during that same time frame was 0%. Before LEC opened in 2010, the Greenville County census tracts surrounding the school featured high school graduation rates as low as 54%. Today, supported by LEC's early college educational model, over 90% of the school's high school scholars graduate on-time, and 100% of these graduates are accepted to college.

While the program is targeted towards newly arrived refugee clients, it is open to the community and promoted through a variety of means. The curriculum was created and tailored for refugee clients using multisensory visual lessons (Prezi presentations) to increase understanding of topics. The standardized lessons provide consistent instruction for all three locations. Lessons are enhanced through workbooks, hands on activities, field trips, and games. The program design was rigorously researched and is aligned with the English Proficiency Standards, the College and Career Readiness Standards, and the Employability Skills Framework. The lessons are taught by a combination of paid staff and trained volunteers. Students are tested on a Best Literacy assessment within 6 hours of initial instruction and again at the end of the class to measure knowledge and understanding of predetermined topics. Students can repeat the classes if needed.","The Newcomers Intensive English Language Training (NIELT) class is a year-round, open enrollment program where students can join class at any point, repeat class, or return to class between employments if needed. Students attend an average of 20 hours of class per week. Each student attends 60 to 80 hours of class before taking the posttest and completing the program. Clients are required to attend class unless there is an extenuating circumstance; consequently, there is a retention rate of 70% with most clients completing the program. The remaining clients who do not complete class usually exit for employment. CCC works closely with community partners and other local agencies such as the Department of Social Services, literacy organizations, Goodwill, city schools' adult education programs, and local workforce centers to direct clients towards employment and educational opportunities. Stated program outcomes will be accomplished by the end of the grant period.","Enrolled students are assessed on the Best Literacy Assessment developed by the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL). This competency-based assessment measures the adult English language learners' ability to read and write English in authentic situations in the United States.

The retention rate is 86%. The ERC seeks to provide comprehensive, tracked, and replicable literacy training; support a trauma-informed learning environment and support positive problem-solving,resiliency and accurate self-perception.","The ERC's objectives for 2019 are to achieve a 200 person enrollment, and refer 50 students to the ERC job coach and employment services. The program also seeks continued increases in reading proficiency and to see 80% passage rate of high school equivalency section tests. MDC anticipates increasing the number of people attaining their full high school equivalency credential by 15% from 2018 outcomes, and to see all move into career-based transitions. In the adult basic education program, 85% of enrolled students will be able to read more consistently, master consumer math skills, and articulate their needs within public systems like the RTA, the court system, or Social Services. The ERC expects to continue to see students who may have high school degrees but who need help developing skills that will prepare them for the workforce, including a need for digital literacy skills. In 2018, 27 students were assessed via CASAS; comparable numbers are anticipated for 2019. The objective is to increase all ESOL students' reading, writing, speaking and listening English skills and support them to citizenship. Our definition of success as a program is to meet individual needs and goals while facilitating each person's lifelong ability to self-assess, self-advocate, and self-determine.","The ERC is designed to support all learners, provide a calm and safe classroom environment, and foster cooperative engagement. Through maintaining a regular schedule, staying open 52 weeks a year, and having no wait period for intake, the ERC removes barriers and increases the likelihood of student participation and success.There is no minimum literacy level and MDC serves many students whose initial test levels are too low for other adult education programs. As a trauma-informed program, MDC does not prescribe attendance levels, nor expect attendance to be consistent. MDC's population faces a myriad of challenges in their daily lives including inconsistent access to transportation, housing, food, and childcare.Many students are in recovery from substance abuse, live with a mental health disorder, and record multiple adverse experiences resulting in symptoms of trauma. For students with so many uncertainties in their lives, there is a comfort in knowing they can come into the classroom and be greeted without question or judgment. Students are assigned a teacher who tracks their progress and adapts learning and assessments while advocating for the student. To better accommodate the needs of all students, the ERC has nearly doubled its hours of instruction since November 2018.The trauma-informed intake process provides all students access to MDC's wrap around services, including basic needs, counseling/case management, and health and wellnessprograms. ","Because the ERC has no wait period for intake, students can start classes the same week they enroll. Upon intake, the student is formally assessed according to their learning goals. That Reading Thing (TRT) is used for students with little or no literacy skills. Another assessment used by the program is Wonderlic GAIN. Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) is used for ESOL students.  In 2019 the program is investigating aligning assessment frequency to match CASAS and GAIN standards of every 60 hours or every quarter, depending on attendance. Teacher-designed assessments will be used in more frequent intervals. The ERC strives for daily improvement in a student's self-awareness and ability to accurately understand their skill development. 2018 saw an actual increase in student hours spent in the classroom (8,231), indicating their commitment to their learning goals. Every student provides daily self-assessments of their progress and monthly assessments of their experience of the classroom and their progress toward their goals.","The ERC uses TRT for students who have no literacy skills. TRT is short, and starts with letter sound basics, therefore, it has been successful with students who have no, or very rudimentary, literacy. Literacy students are further supported in map-reading, numeracy, analog clock reading, handwriting, and computer literacy. The ESOL student is assessed using CASAS. In 2019, the ERC will offer a digital CASAS test for students who prefer that to the paper test. For High School Equivalency preparedness, the Wonderlic GAIN allows for skills-specific assessments. The GAIN also screens for dyslexia and dyscalculia. In 2018 MDC introduced GED Flash for GED prep students. It is an online platform to review for the GED. In addition, students conduct daily and monthly self assessments that allow them to be fully vested in the learning process.

Of all county students tested in grades 3 to 8, 67% were not proficient in English Language Arts and 65% were not proficient in math.  County wide scores were at least 10% lower than statewide averages.  These students are at risk for low literacy. ",,"CAPCO will offer 140 students grade level, tailored instruction in the five subjects of the TASC exam.  Study options include: classroom, home study. or tutoring.Ten students will have career based instruction.  At least 50 students will have 12 or more hours; 45 students will take the TASC exam; 30 will earn their diplomas; 10 will pass 2 to 4 of the five exams.  An additional 15 students will have grade level improvement. Eighteen literacy students will meet literacy or life-skill goals. ","Goal 1.  Provide 120 youth and adults with opportunities to gain the subject knowledge and critical thinking skills needed to earn a High School Equivalency diploma.  Objectives:  At least 50 students will attend 12 or more hours of instruction.  Forty-five (45) will take the TASC exam.  Thirty (30) will earn their High School Equivalency diplomas by passing all five TASC tests.  Ten will pass 2 to 4 of the exams.  Fifteen will improve 2 grade levels in TABE Reading or math.  Goal 2:  Provide 20 lower (grades 0-4) ABE learners with a tutor or class instruction.  Objectives:  At least 18 learners will meet personal literacy or life-skills goals identified at enrollment or during review sessions. Fifteen will attend at least one of three enrichment programs offered through the year. Recruit five new volunteers to maintain a pool of ten volunteer tutors.  Goal 3:  Provide ten (10) learners with career based instruction.  Objectives:  Using industry focused texts, provide industry specific math instruction to at least 5 adult learners.  Recruit at least 5 adult learners into CAPCO's 12 week work skills workshop series.  Goal 4: Provide professional development to 3 staff and 10 volunteers.  Objectives:  Work with RSVP to provide three training sessions for new tutors.  Offer current tutors four mini-trainings on subjects they identify. For staff, identify  and attend at least one webinar or development opportunity each quarter.  ","Our program design supports meeting our goals and objectives amidst the reality of growing enrollment, three part-time staff, and increased complexity of both TABE and TASC exams.  1. Values-Based Approach. We relate all aspects of our program to four values:  Respect, Good Mind, Curiosity, and Persistence. We respect all students for their courage and unique life experience. Conversation with students about how these values reinforce their own learning process also serves to improve retention.  2. Enrichment for the Literacy Students. One staff member concentrates on supporting the literacy students and their tutors. In addition to the literacy work, she helps these students develop community through activities ranging from painting classes to reading to therapy dogs.  3. Workplace Related Problem-Solving.  For students with specific career goals, we will use texts that link industry specific math problems to the standards addressed in the TASC and TABE exams. We will also use more work related problems in daily discussions. 4.  Effective Use of Staff, Space, and Volunteers. Staff meets twice a month to discuss student progress and operations.  We have redesigned how the classroom is used, providing times when literacy tutors may work with students here (rather than in libraries).  We are also using regular tutor training sessions as impetus for recording our approach to accelerating students' learning curves in multiple subjects.  ","CAPCO's High School Equivalency Program is ongoing. We have open enrollment and are open all year round, closing only for major holidays or adverse weather conditions. Currently we have morning and afternoon classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays and evening classes on Monday and Thursdays that are focused on upper ABE and HSE students. Monday and Wednesday mornings, classroom is available for tutors of lower literacy students. Several tutors meet students weekly at a convenient public place. Additional individual tutoring is available by appointment. We encourage students to attend at least two classroom hours a week -- or one hour of individual tutoring a week. We have an average of 3 or 4 students taking the TASC exam every month.  We use the agency van to transport students to and from the testing sites, if needed. One of our testing partners hold graduation ceremonies each June.  This March recent graduates have taken the lead in organizing our own graduation ceremony. We provide in-service training every quarter for volunteers and teachers. We survey students twice a year.  ","CAPCO uses The Adult Basic Education (TABE) Battery forms 9 and 10 to measure baseline and grade level improvement. All students take the TABE Reading and Math at enrollment.  We use the TABE diagnostics to develop individual programing. (We are evaluating how to implement TABE 11 & 12.) Adults who enroll for tutoring in basic life-skills / literacy identify specific goals. The program co-ordinator monitors their progress and goal completion through personal interview. Students and teachers use checklists of academic knowledge areas to monitor progress through the different subject areas. Student attendance is recorded daily and compiled monthly. Students are post-tested with the TABE at intervals of 20-30 hours of attendance to monitor improvement in basic math and reading skills. HSE students preparing for the official TASC exam must take the TASC Readiness test before applying for that exam. We currently use TASC Readiness 5. We conduct a Student Satisfaction Survey twice a year. In every student encounter, teachers evaluate student progress and adapt instruction to facilitate student learning, reward student motivation, and encourage student's intellectual and emotional growth. The New York State Dept. of State monitors our progress quarterly on program goals related to the CSBG grant. The NYS Dept. of Education sends us quarterly reports comparing our test TASC results to state averages.  Two local funders send observers to our classroom once a year.","CAPCO is housed in a one story, 16,080 square foot building in the heart of Cortland, NY. The building was completely renovated in 1999 and houses the agency's director and finance staff, the Head Start administration, the WIC clinic, Energy Services, free community clothing closet, and Family Development staff. The education program has access to two rooms for classes -- a full-time dedicated classroom and the agency's board room (for evening classes). Classroom computers have access to internet and printing. Staff also has access to the agency printer (which the agency maintains) which is useful for providing students with copies of materials.  Last spring the entire building had a communications technology upgrade, including wireless internet access. Volunteer tutors meet students at five public libraries in our county, at a community center in an old train station, or in or classroom, two mornings a week. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned each evening.  Students comment on the friendly atmosphere of the classroom and building.  We have a good supply of standard print adult education textbooks.  We hope to purchase in the future some of the newer books which align math instruction with typical industry specific problems and applications.   ","Our main classroom has four brand new student Chromebooks and two staff computers (three years old) available for instruction and internet access. We also have one laptop available for the program and one tablet for the classroom teacher. While the ratio of computers to students may seem small given the size of annual enrollment, since we rarely have more than six students in any one class session, the class ratio is actually 1:1. Computers have bookmarked free educational programs, such as Khan Academy, and tutorials for the TASC exam. Right now, we are beginning to help lower literacy students learn to log into Khan Academy.We have an ""Enhanced Vision"" electronic reader for a student who is legally blind on loan from the New York State Commission for the Blind. In the agency boardroom used for the night class, CAPCO has a TV, DVD player, smart board, and overhead projector used with the laptop for conducting research. The agency plans to move the projector to the classroom to use with a donated screen that is already mounted. For math, we have sets of fraction bars, compasses, protractors, rulers, and Texas Instrument TI-20XS multi view calculators. We also have wall maps and a Periodic Table.  Last spring, the agency upgraded wireless connections for the entire building.  Students who have smart phones tend to use those for their research.  ",Yes,"CAPCO is asking for $340 in technology and software.  $200 will be used to purchase four sets of headphones and 4 wireless mice - for our 4 Chromebooks. Students can use in class to research topics of interest, access Khan Academy for additional math support, and practice writing in electronic formats.  $140 will be used to purchase TASC Readiness online practice seats and software. These online practice tests can be adjusted to the parameters of students' accommodations, enabling students to practice using actual testing conditions. Teachers can use test results to adjust coaching techniques as students prepare for exams. ","$67,249.00 ","$67,249.00 ","CAPCO is requesting $8,000, about 12% of our total budget. These funds will help pay one teacher salary, provide students with copies of instructional materials, augment technology-based services, and transport students to TASC exams. We are asking for $6,910 for 33% of the part-time HSE teacher's salary.  These dollars support the day and evening classes for most students who pre-test at 5th grade or above. We can then shift some funds to increase programming for the lower level ABE literacy student. Software - $140 will purchase 20 online seats for the online practice TASC Readiness exam. Travel - $500 will cover costs of transporting students out of county to TASC testing sites.  We make two to four 50 mile round trips each month.

Maine recognizes adult illiteracy as a state-wide concern for employment (Maine Department of Education, 2015).",,"The number of students served in this project is 200. For the purpose of researching the effectiveness of the program, 20 students will be randomly selected to participate in a quasi-experimental study. Beginning reading instruction will be provided through a reading software specifically developed for adolescents and adults with disabilities and/or struggling readers. The expected outcome is that all participants will improve the accuracy of the words they practice in the software. ","The target population is older adolescents (i.e., 16+) and adults with or without disabilities and significant reading challenges. The age of 16 was selected as that is when students with disabilities begin transitioning to adult services; it is anticipated that only a small portion of the population will include those who are 16 and 17, and those that are will be in self-contained functional skills classroom (e.g., daily living skills, basic reading) with students with disabilities up to 21 years old (e.g., age students with disabilities can receive special education). Disabilities refers to any diagnosed condition impacting cognition; disabilities may include a learning disability in reading, autism, and intellectual disability (IQ below 70). Significant reading challenges is a reading level of second grade or lower. Two hundred students will be targeted. Based on population data, it is anticipated the majority will be Caucasian (170); of the total 200, 180 will be ABE and 20 ESL. At least half will have a disability or were identified with a disability during K12 education. The web-based reading software for this project allows student practice sets of 20 words. It is anticipated that the majority of student a will make progress of 5 or less out 20 correct to at least 15 out of 20 correct from pre to posttest per word set. To evaluate if RR is age-appropriate, students will complete a brief interview rating their beliefs (e.g., if would use again, usefulness).","Individuals with reading challenges, with or without a disability, may lack the needed reading abilities for competitive employment and daily living. The purpose of project is to implement a web-based reading software, Responsive Reading (RR) to improve beginning reading in adults with an age-appropriate software as existing options are targeted to young children (images of RR: http://tinyurl.com/y3sk74md). RR provides a way to review words, including as a supplement to words the student is learning in an adult education setting. RR's focus is adults with an ABE or less, ESL, and/or with disabilities to provide a free, accessible, usable, and effective means to practice reading words. RR currently includes the first 20 Fry Words (e.g., set words making up 65% of English), but can be customized for the user. In RR, the student hears an audio prompt of a word and a prompt to select the correct choice, this repeats several times with one then two other word choices. This project will support continued development and implementation with up to 200 students. Additional development includes the ability to add additional sets of 20 words and an option to practice the word in a sentence (e.g., word: and; question: ""The cat _ dog are pets"" with options to select of and, are, a). Ongoing pilot testing suggests that RR is easy to use and effective. The author has partnered with local literacy programs (e.g., Literacy Volunteers of Bangor; Bangor, ME) and community partners to use RR.","May to July 2019: Conclude current pilot testing and development of RR including additional sets of 20 words and using words in sentences; current features will be updated, as needed, based on pilot testing data (ongoing, not a part of this grant). A developer has been identified and has agreed to complete development on RR.August and September 2019: Pretests (Note: Pretests may occur earlier, as soon as development is completed)September to March 2020: Students will use RR. The number of weekly instructional hours may vary, as some students may use RR more than others and opt to repeat words. It is anticipated that users will use RR for at least an hour a week. Student progress within RR will be monitored weekly; RR allows and administrator to track the number of correct responses and time spent, which an administrator could then use to have a student repeat a word or spend additional time in RR. During this time period, a subset of 20 students will participate in a research study (see ""Measurable Results""). March 2020: Posttest (Note: Students and literacy community partners will be able to continue using RR indefinitely at no cost).","Students will complete a pre and posttest assessments, before and after using RR: (1) The Bader Reading and Language Inventory (7th edition), a reading assessment appropriate for adults; and (2) a pre and posttest consisting of reading each of the 20 words in RR per word set (Note: the pre and posttest will be embedded in RR). Prior to posttest, users will complete each word sequence of three levels in RR; this consists of hearing and then clicking on the target word with just that word on the screen, hearing then selecting the target word with one ""distractor"" word (e.g., word that looks or sounds the same) correctly for three times, hearing then selecting the target word with two ""distractor"" words correctly for three times, and then selecting the word in the context of a sentence three times. Students can restart a level as many times as needed. Students will complete the word sequence for each of the 20 words per set in RR. Following completion, students will take posttests, consisting of the same items as the pretests. No formal assessment will take place while the students are using RR, but RR will track the number of correct responses per word and number of attempts, and time spent on each word. ","The University of Maine has the needed facilities, including grant management and budget administrators, to implement this project. The University of Maine also has the needed sever space to host RR and the website domain; the cost of the sever space is included in the budget and is also more cost effective than an outside website server host. The ASAP Media Service Lab, undergraduate student developers overseen by Michael Scott, has all needed software and equipment to develop RR. No equipment or supplies are needed that are not already available (e.g., computer to store data, assessments, statistical software for data analysis, photocopying).","Because multiple community partners will be involved in this project, ranging from stand-alone literacy centers to adult education classrooms, it is not possible to list all the available technology, age, or ratio of student to technology. However, there are no concerns with students' ability to access RR either through their own devices or computers and tablets at any community partner location. RR was specifically created to be able to used on any type of computer or mobile device, including phones. It was also created without using Java-based programming, allowing for the student to avoid any needed software updates or a device not being compatible.

It allows each participant to engage and have positive exchanges with their peers.  Additionally, it affords them the opportunity to connect with members of the community, enabling them to broaden their perspective on issues that they may face inside or outside of the prison walls. The creation of a book club which involves community involvement will help introduce the idea of victim empathy, new ideas and opinions, and also give participants the opportunity to engage in healthy dialogue regarding complex issues such as drug usage, illiteracy, abuse, mental illness, etc. The project also aims to introduce literary devices that may be peculiar to students, but will give greater understanding to the text.","TimelineThe Renewing of Minds Through Literacy, Inc. received approval to provide re-entry services at The State Farm Complex in December 2018.

Southwest Detroit residents post employment rates of 13.8% as compared to 7.8% in Michigan. Getting to work has been challenging for this population with 21.7 percent of households with no access to a vehicle and the average travel time to work being 26.6 minutes.  ,Drop-out rates for Detroit students lag behind State of Michigan and US high school students. Detroit students' drop-out rates are 65% as compared to 74% of Michigan students and 80% nationwide.  ,"Aggregate data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey indicate higher levels of poverty in southwest Detroit than in Detroit. Almost 16% of Michigan residents, 38% in Detroit and 41% in Southwest Detroit live in poverty. More individuals (30 percent) earn less than $15,000 in Southwest Detroit as compared to 29% in Detroit. Twenty-seven percent of all families and 40% of families with a female householder and no husband present had incomes below the poverty level.  ",Demographic data collected by SWES of southwest Detroit residents likely to use the services of partnering agencies include the following:46% of those over age 25 do not have a high school diploma; 50% speak a primary language other than English (most commonly Spanish.); 56% of those over 16 are not employed; 72% of participants have children classified as having Limited English Proficiency,,"The Adult Learning Labs are two community-based education centers in the heart of southwest Detroit and are operated by SWES. Approximately 250 students will enroll in ABE, GED, and ESL classes over the course of one year with a minimum of 12 hours of instruction (online and in-class instruction). Approximately 125 students will increase reading and/or math post-program, and 25 ABE students will attain a 9th grade reading level. Sixty will pass at least one subject of the GED test.","Qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods will be used to measure the anticipated outcomes. Program objectives include:* To increase residents' access to learning spaces in southwest Detroit that improve educational and economic self-sufficiency outcomes* To provide improved programming to students at the adult Learning Labs in southwest Detroit to address the heightened demands for career and school success (e.g. GED requirements).Outcomes include:* Approximately 250 students will enroll in ABE, GED and ESL classes and attend a minimum of 12 hours* Retention of 146 students for a minimum of 40 hours for ESL, ABE and GED to be eligible to post-test* Approximately 125 students will demonstrate an increased assessment scale scores in reading and/or math post-program.* Approximately 25 ABE students will attain a 9th grade reading level* Sixty GED students will pass at least one subject of the GED test* Seventy-five students will participate in financial literacy workshops* Approximately 175 students will attend a career navigation presentation*Twelve students will earn their HSE credential","The program design includes outreach, recruitment, enrollment and intake, assessment, classes and tutoring, post testing, GED test pre-testing and support services. Funding for this proposal would particularly help classroom instruction by allowing us to add instructional hours and support teacher training. During the intake process, students complete an individual learning plan that captures education and employment goals and an assessment test that measures reading, math and English language proficiency for class placement. Most students test in at such low reading and math levels that it will take an extended period of time to prepare for the GED test or gain the necessary language proficiency for employment in the conventional workplace. Students in the ABE and GED programs register for an English and math class, and ESL students take two reading and listening classes per week. For online programs, ESL students use Burlington English, ABE/GED uses Skills Tutor, Aztec GED Software and Khan Academy. We also use GED Ready practice tests to see if students are ready to take the official test. All students can take a post-test after 40 hours of attendance.Funding from Dollar General would support: a) increased teaching hours to respond to growing program enrollments; b) registration and travel stipend for the 2019 GED conference in Chicago; c) purchase of six new Dell desktop computers to replace outdated technology; and d) expansion of instructional materials","The Timeline for the program will run from May 13, 2019 through April 3, 2020. Students will be enrolled in two classes for a minimum of six hours per week during each 10 week semester. We offer 5, 10 week semesters annually. This has shown to be more effective in retaining students by providing them with incremental goals as motivation. The intake process will take place prior to the beginning of each term. New students will be assessed for baseline data and current students with the required hours of attendance will take a post-test. Students who test out of ABE will be able to transition to GED classes. ESL students who reach the high intermediate testing level may transition to ABE classes. GED students testing at the 11th grade level will take the GED practice tests to determine readiness to take the official GED test.Students will exit the program when they have reached the goal of taking the GED test, achieved a specified level of competency in reading or math or proficiency in English language.","Students will be assessed using standard tests approved by the state of Michigan's Office of Adult Education. We currently use CASAS for ESL and TABE for ABE/GED. On July 1, 2019, our program will transition to CASAS testing for all students.All students must take an assessment before the program begins to provide an academic baseline and for placement at the appropriate class level. The same assessments are used to post-test after 40 hours of attendance for ABE, GED and ESL students.All students will have access to the online instructional program Skills Tutor, reading and math modules available from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The program has multiple levels from beginning to advanced, and provides pre and post-tests for each lesson. Program use and test results will be monitored by teachers through online reports.GED Ready practice tests available from the GED Testing Service will also be used when a student's TABE score shows mastery of all areas in a subject. These tests replicate the official test and provide a detailed report and recommendation on the likelihood of passing.Teachers will also use informal evaluation tools including unit tests and quizzes as well as writing assignments in classes to measure student progress.","Southwest Solutions has two facilities on W.

",,"The expanded Passport to College program will provide 650 students (ages 16-65+) with free, comprehensive, and individualized basic skills, ESL, and HSE tutoring, college exam and enrollment preparation, career training and job placement, and wraparound support services. We expect students will obtain an HSE, improve English proficiency, or successfully transition to college and the workplace. Measurable outcomes include academic advancement, college/training enrollment, and stable employment.","From April 2019 -- March 2020, we expect to provide educational and support services to 650 students through the expanded Passport Program.

Quantitative measures of short-term progress are assessment tests. We monitor outcomes through regular contact with participants. Because our program emphasizes relational service and individual mentoring, we are able to maintain connection with our students to collect data to verify their progress. Participants complete surveys at least once every six months to provide feedback, and we continue to collect informal verbal feedback as appropriate. Management reviews program performance on an ongoing basis. Program participation fosters a college-going culture and builds students' self-efficacy, strengthening their desire for continued college success. Over time, it increases their persistence levels and degree attainment. Program completion raises students' chances of employment and income growth. ","Our goal is to expand our Passport program to meet recent high demand (58% increased enrollment since July 2018), and serve 100 additional students. This program provides students with 5 main services: academic preparation for basic skills and HSE, English language instruction and civics for ELLs, college preparation and connection, workplace readiness and training, and wraparound support services. Academic preparation ranges from basic skills instruction to HSE readiness. Next, students can prepare for the college entrance exam and receive individualized advising and enrollment support for their chosen degree path. Our self-paced curriculum, added rigor, plus our student-centered tutoring model, allows students to efficiently prepare for their exams. Additionally, online instruction via Plato gives them the ability to work anywhere and also receive hands-on experience with the technology needed for college and the workplace. English and Civics instruction is delivered in small multi-level classes, where students are placed in cohorts to encourage cooperation and peer support. Concurrently, HSE and ELL students can choose to enroll in a free, short-term training (3-5 mo) for an in-demand occupation where they are coached in college and workplace skills. Finally, students are provided with wraparound support services from a college and career success coach to assist them with meeting emergency needs, and who provides support with transitioning to college or the workforce.","The Passport program operates year-round at our centrally located learning center with open enrollment. All students complete a 12-hour orientation to assess fit and readiness for the program. Students and staff create an individuated Training, Education, & Career Plan (ITEC) to set short-term and long-term goals. Students spend their first 40-50 hours improving basic skills and then take a progress test. After, students move on to HSE practice exams, college exam preparation, or workforce training. On average, each student receives 100+ instructional hours, with many utilizing 200+. The program is self-paced, and students' enrollment length can last from 6 mo-2 years, depending on their educational goals and their academic readiness and English proficiency at enrollment. Since students have adult responsibilities, we allow students to come in at any time during operating hours, which now include 4 late evenings and every Saturday. This flexibility allows students to arrange a schedule that fits their needs. The use of distance learning software and take home packets allow for additional flexibility. In-demand career trainings are offered multiple times during the year, and include day and evening options. While in the program, students complete a minimum of 8 hours per week of instruction. This process keeps students and staff on track during the year, and allows for the necessary adjustments to ensure progress. We will serve 650 students from April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020.","Program success is contingent upon student success and achievement of outcomes, specifically academic gains.

Curriculum completion is tracked in student learning plans (ITEC). Distance Learning software enables staff to monitor student activity, review assessment results, and adjust learning needs in order to meet outcomes. HSE practice vouchers will provide us with immediate results and allow us to tailor remediation toward each exam. We have a great track record for success, i.e. for the past 4 years, we were 1 of only 2 local HSE programs, to meet all federal performance measures and had the highest % of HSE completions. ","We outgrew our previous location and moved into a facility owned by a local foundation in June 2018. This main site consists of one large classroom, an orientation room with computer bar, reception space, 3 offices, and three mid-size training rooms/classrooms, approximately 7,500 square feet in total. These spaces are connected and provide for administrative offices, a reception area, a computer lab, and a large learning center. The learning center section is equipped to handle up to 75 students at one time, and our computer lab allows for 35 students, plus a training room laptop cart adds 25 more computers. Due to the flexibility of our student attendance schedule, and in order to best serve this student population, attendance is staggered so that we do not exceed this capacity at any one time. Since we moved into this larger facility, through the help of a local foundation, we have seen a 58% increase in student enrollment and are trying to meet their needs in this new space. We are within one mile of the San Antonio College campus and 3 miles of Good Careers Academy, providing our students with direct access to campus services. Our close proximity to college and training programs also provides easy access to the college for resources and ease of matriculation. We stock school supplies, curriculum, and other necessities through either program purchase or in-kind donations on a regular basis so as to keep the program free to students.","Throughout the Passport Program, students are exposed to various forms of technology.

(1) We calculate rates for enrollment (12 hours of attendance or more) and post-testing (usually after 50 hours of attendance for HSE students and 70 hours for ESL students) to evaluate success in helping learners to persist and advance academically. (2) Formal assessments help determine class placement and assess progress. All adults are tested either via the TABE (D or A level) or CASAS (for ESL learners) at the start of the application process to gauge skill level for appropriate placement. After instruction begins, CLC administers these tests periodically to measure progress. HSE learners preparing to take the GED exam take a GED Ready test at the start of their specific subject class and then one at the end of it to assess progress and GED exam readiness. (3) Ongoing tracking of learner achievement of core goals keeps our educators informed on individual learner progress and helps ensure we meet target outcomes by the end of the year.

The expected outcome is an increase in the number of students that demonstrate a learning gain as measured through federally approved standardized assessments.,"During this fiscal year we have served a total of 37 level one and two ESOL students. Thus far, 19 (51%) of those students have advanced at least one Student Performance Level (SPL) within a 4 month period.  Additionally, there are currently 90 individuals waiting for a seat in our ESOL classes. Of those 90 individuals, 76 require a seat in either Level 1 or Level 2 while only 14 are waiting for a seat in Level 3. With this project we propose adding a day a week to our level 1 and 2 classes which will increase the intensity of instruction and accelerate student learning gains.The objective of this project is to increase the number of students that advance from one Student Performance Level (SPL) to the next thereby increasing the rate of students progressing through the program and subsequently opening up more spaces for prospective students on the waiting list.","Classes currently meet two mornings a week each.

Most of our learners speak limited English, thus they are over-represented in menial labor & service jobs that pay low wages without benefits.  We serve many immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries & from Haiti who are hardworking, but learning a language takes time. They struggle to find jobs that sustain them.","The dropout rate was 6.1% in 2016 (the most recent year for which statistics are available from the National Center for Education Statistics.)  Our experience tells us that graduation does not guarantee, however, the ability to read at a 5th grade level.  Drop-outs and graduates alike may find themselves limited in employment opportunities and in helping their children with their own learning due to difficulty with reading and writing.  ","The poverty level in our county is 13.4%, but the cities we serve most within the county are poorer.  Lake Worth is 27.6%, Riviera Beach is 22.4%, West Palm Beach is 18.9%, and Lake Park is 18.7%.  Our students tend to come from the poorest neighborhoods in our cities and our free services are essential for them.  Every penny they make must be used for basic needs.","14.2% of adults in our county are illiterate, according to statistics from the PBC literacy coalition.  Because 63% of jobs require at least some post-secondary education (Georgetown Center on Education & the Workforce), this means that 14.2% of adults cannot meet the minimum requirements for a majority of jobs.  Low literacy costs the U.S. $225 billion per year in non-productivity, crime, & loss of tax revenue.  However, society reaps $7.14 in return for every dollar spent on adult literacy. ",,"We anticipate that the new classroom technology will impact 175 of our students in the year following installation.  Most of the use will be with our small-group classes (5 or fewer), and will consist of language instruction using resources from our textbook publisher that are available on flash drives, and using online resources as well.  Our tutors will have access to new tools for instruction, and our students will show increased engagement in their course of study.","At least 175 adult learners will engage in class activities using the wall monitors during their regularly-scheduled classes.  At least 8 tutors will receive instruction in how to use the new wall monitors, and will present at least two lessons to their classes using the new technology.  We will conduct two group trainings for tutors and we will provide one-to-one instruction for 10 additional tutors.  Since our new ESOL curriculum includes video and audio resources on flash drives, we will make those available to all 18 tutors who will be teaching in those classrooms.  ","This project entails the purchase and installation of three Dell 55 Conference Room Monitors, which will be connected to a laptop in each of three classrooms.  The monitors will display whatever is on the screen of the laptop, and they include full sound, which enables everyone in the classroom to hear what's being played on the laptop.  Language instruction requires much repetition, and students stay much more engaged if they have good auditory resources and strong visual components in each lesson.  Our new curriculum, which we just adopted this year due to unavailability of the old textbooks, incorporates photos from the  National Geographic organization, and also includes videos and audio files especially created to with each lesson.  We currently have two of these monitors, which were installed in July of 2018, and our tutors and students all want to be in the classrooms with those monitors.  We would like to provide the same technology and high-quality instruction to all of our students, and three more monitors will give us much greater capacity.  Tutors have been limited in their ability to create supplementary materials of their own on a larger scale.  This enables them to create PowerPoint presentations, or use You Tube instructional videos to enhance the textbook resources. ","We would like to install the three monitors in June, and have them ready for use by our tutors by the end of June.  We operate continuously, year round, so the monitors will be in use every day we're open during the coming year.  The 175 students who benefit directly from this technology will receive 1.5 hours of instruction, twice per week, for as long as they attend.  Our typical retention period is three years for our ESOL students.  We will hold the group trainings for tutors in July and August, and continue with one-to-one trainings as needed.  We also have monthly tutor training for new tutors, and use of the technology will be part of the training agenda. ","The monitors will be one component in a full educational program that includes textbooks, classroom activities, computer lab and iPad usage, and conversation groups.  The monitors will be a vital component of this multi-faceted program which will result in at least 67 students showing progress toward their educational goals, which are recorded in our database.  Progress toward goals will be defined as test scores showing evidence of language improvement, as well as attainment of jobs, degrees, or new book levels that were stated as goals when the student registered or moved to a new level.  Initial testing is done with a specially-designed placement test that includes listening, hearing, speaking, vocabulary and reading components.  This replaced Best Plus for our program because we needed a fuller picture of students' capabilities than that test provided.  Periodic tests are given, also, and are provided by the publisher of our curriculum.  End-of-unit tests, and end-of book tests are given and scores are documented.  A passing score must be obtained prior to a student moving onto the next book.  Certificates are given when students move from one book to another, as well.  ","We have four classrooms identified that are in need of the monitors.  All have electric outlets and wall space that will accommodate the connections, and we have experience with hiring installers for two similar monitors.  ","We have a computer lab with PCs that are approximately 3 years old, and a wall monitor that is less than a year old.  Eight of our nine classrooms do not have computers or monitors at all; one classroom is fitted with a laptop and monitor and is in high demand by classes that wish to use it.  We also have 16 iPads that can be used in classrooms or in the lab.  They are almost four years old.  ",Yes,"Language learning requires multiple skills:  reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Effective teaching of language skills involves not only print resources, but also video and audio resources.  Our new curriculum from Cengage provides those resources on flash drives, which allow the instructor to share them with his/her class.  Having the wall monitors is a giant upgrade from having a group of people huddled around one computer screen.  Digital literacy is one component of full literacy, and becoming familiar with technology in the classroom is an added benefit for students who are adding to their repertoire in order to advance in employment and/or future education.","$5,700.00 ","$5,700.00 ","The total cost of the project includes the purchase of three wall-sized monitors, and three laptops to run the monitors, as well as mounting hardware and professional installation.

The West Virginia Library Commission provides data showing 19% of the adults in Cabell County and 21% in Wayne County do not meet the minimum standard for being ""literate"" by the National Institute for Literacy.",,"The CCLA, serving approximately 175 learners, blends traditional adult education with intensive support services to address learners as holistically as possible. The Instructor blends classroom instruction with one-on-one meetings to provide supportive counseling, assistance with goals, and referrals. Through this approach, our learners will achieve these outcomes: increase their Educational Functioning Level, earn industry-recognized credentials, and transition to post-secondary education.","The CCLA welcomes all adults 18 and older who want to improve academic and job readiness skills. With this target population in mind, the CCLA projects the following objectives, outcomes, and indicators:- Learners will increase their Educational Functioning Level after a minimum of 30 hours of instruction. Of the 176 enrolled learners, 71 learners will achieve 30 hours or more of instructional time, which could include classroom instruction, independent study with online curriculum, and/or special topic information sessions. Of those 71 learners, 51 will increase their Educational Functioning Level.  - Learners will earn industry-recognized credentials (i.e. customer service, work ethics, etc.) that will make them more competitive in the job market. Enrolled learners have access to a myriad of curriculum that provide the opportunity to earn work and job readiness credentials that will serve them long after their enrollment at the CCLA. Of the 176 enrolled learners, 88 will earn at least one industry-recognized credential.- Learners will transition to post-secondary education and training. Post-secondary education includes institutions of higher education where students have the opportunity to earn an associate's degree and higher. Post-secondary training includes vocational institutions where students can earn a certificate or higher. Of the 176 enrolled learners, 101 will enroll in some post-secondary program.","The CCLA model blends traditional adult education with intensive support services. We begin this process from day one. Starting at orientation, the Instructor assesses the learner through career exploration activities, an interest inventory, the C.I.T.E. Learning Styles Instrument, and the TABE assessment to gain a sense of the learner's strengths and interests pertaining to higher education or a career. This information is then used to help the learner develop an Individualized Learning Plan (ILP) that reflects his or her goals. Goals about education and careers are focal, but the Instructor encourages the learner to think about a broad spectrum of issues ranging from housing to transportation to child care.The learner begins to transition out of the CCLA upon achieving satisfactory results on formal and informal assessments that correspond to the ILP. When the learner is ready to exit the program, he or she meets with the Instructor one last time to set goals and action steps to guide the next steps in the transition. The intensive support provided by the Instructor throughout the program encourages learners to persist in their learning goals and better positions them for work and life in general upon exiting the program. It is through this approach that learners obtain the skills they need to advance on their pathway to education and work, thereby securing a better and brighter future for themselves and their families.","May 2019 - Grant announced:- Implement communications and marketing plan for recruitment of adult learners, community partners, and volunteers.- Schedule volunteer training workshops (June 2019 -- April 2020).- Schedule special topic ""fast track"" sessions (i.e. Career Readiness, High School Equivalency, and Technology Fundamentals, etc.)  Fast track sessions are short-term, high intensity course offerings that support learners as they earn career certifications, increase their Education Functioning Level, and prepare for entry into the workforce or into a post-secondary educational institution. These offerings will be provided several times throughout the grant period, and learners will have the flexibility to make up for any missed sessions (June 2019 -- April 2020).- Adult learners enrolled during the grant period will be receiving, on average, six instructional hours a week. Adult learners also have the option for extra study time at home through utilization of our online curriculum offerings.- Learners will be formally reassessed after every 30 contact hours earned. Further, learners and the Instructor will also review their ILPs at regular intervals.","The CCLA has several methods and tools to assess the effectiveness of the program. The TABE is our formal assessment instrument to measure learning gains. The ILPs are our informal instrument. The TABE is administered to learners at 30-hour instructional intervals and the ILP is reviewed with each learner after the TABE is administered.In addition to the instruments described above, the Instructor completes weekly and monthly tracker tools. The Weekly Attendance Tracker helps staff measure things like enrollment, retention, and average attendance hours per learner. Additionally, it alerts staff to learners that may need additional support or wraparound support services to stay enrolled. The TABE Tracker keeps a monthly tally of all learners' Education Functioning Level gains and the Monthly Tracker provides a snapshot of all pertinent classroom data. The Instructor submits weekly reports to their supervisor to obtain feedback and facilitate discussion on program strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to improve performance.

Unemployment among our target population of Hispanics is historically much higher; according to the BLS, the national average unemployment rate was 3.6% in 2018, with Hispanic/Latino average at 4.3%.","According to data from the Colorado Department of Education, the state average drop-out rate for 2018 is 2.2%, with Hispanic students having a statewide drop-out rate of 3.5%. The drop-out rates within El Paso County, CO, vary by each school district. To give a specific example, however, the average drop-out rate at District 11 is 2.71%. The Hispanic/Latino student population accounts for 31% of total students, but the drop-out rate for these students is higher at 3.2% in 2018. ","Using the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 72,700 individuals in El Paso County, Colorado are estimated to be living below the poverty level. This is approximately 11.1% of the county population. 19.4% of our Hispanic/Latino residents are living below the poverty level. The Federal Poverty Guideline for a family of three is $20,780, though by the most recent Colorado Self-Sufficiency Standard, the same family of three would need to bring in $59,694 annually to cover basic needs.

Over 300 individual students were instructed last year alone.","Catholic Charities focuses on programs and services that enhance the resiliency of individuals and families, providing a step out of crisis and towards thriving and stability. Our English as a Second Language classes improve student's ability to function in daily life and to thrive in the community.  Our objective is to increase student's abilities in specific areas relating to success completing critical tasks of daily living and to thriving in the community. Key objectives for student progress include: obtaining better or improved employment, communicating with key professionals (i.e. medical personnel, child(ren)'s teachers), completing tasks of daily living, and overall stress reduction. These outcomes are measured by survey which is administered once each semester.  Catholic Charities' ESL program seeks to serve at least 300 individuals each school year. Each student identifies goals they have for their lives by participating in English language classes. The objectives mentioned above are also encouraged of each enrolled student throughout their progression with the English language. ","We offer ESL classes to adults at five locations in Colorado Springs and one in Castle Rock, with morning and evening sessions. Each student attends four hours of weekly instruction, with six different class levels to accommodate different proficiency levels. We utilize an evidence-based, standards-based curriculum from National Geographic called ""Stand Out"". The curriculum provides students with the foundations and tools needed to achieve success in life, college, and career and puts language in the context of real-life situations. Vocabulary and expressions are related to situations where students may find themselves, such as a department or grocery store, the doctor's office, or the Department of Motor Vehicles. In class, students participate in vocabulary-building alongside simple techniques for understanding and remembering grammar constructions. Short stories bring home the lesson and increase the relevancy of language in context.  We also offer citizenship classes and enrichment sessions. Citizenship classes occur at one of our Colorado Springs locations twice yearly. Each course is 13 sessions. Our immigration attorney counsels participants in eligibility and in the citizenship process.  We offer childcare/early literacy at all but one of our locations. We train, manage and support more than 35 volunteers who teach the ESL classes, with a Master's level professional of Teaching English as a Second Language on site at each location for support.  ","Our English classes schedule mirrors that of the academic year. Registration and classes begin in September. There is a two-week winter break between semesters, and graduation is at the end of May. Each class meets twice weekly for two hours each session. Students therefore each attend class for at least four (4) hours each week. There are 30 weeks in which class meets throughout the year, and 60 class sessions in all. We facilitate summer tutoring among several of the students.  ","We use the Stand Out curriculum from National Geographic. The curriculum is evidence-based and standards-based. We utilize the corresponding assessment tool for student placement and the unit tests for measuring student progress.  Initial assessment of language proficiency incorporates the written assessment tool from Stand Out, an oral assessment component, as well as information gained about a student's language experience from the registration form.  Assessment of student progress is accomplished through unit testing combined with teacher assessment of a student's progress. We track student progress by administering unit tests throughout the year. On average, each student takes 12 unit tests during our school year. During our 2017-2018 school year, 92% of the 711 unit tests taken obtained passing scores.  ",All locations have classroom space available for each literacy level that is taught at that session.

We will enroll a combined total of 510 unduplicated individuals over the funding period, as well as 1,100 duplicated enrollments, across all four class cycles (winter, spring, summer, fall). We also strive to have 433 unduplicated students (85%) attend at least 75% of classes. The program will offer 24 class sections for each of the fall, winter, and spring cycles of classes, and three during the summer cycle. Finally, as the goal of most students taking ESOL courses is to enhance job prospects or advance their current career, Catholic Charities staff will connect all 510 students to our Employment Referral Program, which helps individuals apply for, obtain, and maintain work. We aim to make a long-term, sustainable impact on our students' lives, and by helping them secure employment, we empower them to establish a career path that leads to financial stability.With DGLF funding, the ESOL program will launch a pilot hybrid class model for high level students, with one class per week taught online and the remaining class instruction taught in-person. Our goal is to enroll 100 students in our pilot online/in-person class structure during the funding period. ","Catholic Charities ESOL classes are offered at various levels, and students are placed in the appropriate class based on the results of a Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) pre-test. Courses offered include Spanish and English pre-literacy, beginner, intermediate and advanced classes. Advanced students focus on solidifying abilities that will prepare them for the GED Exam, college courses, or career advancement. Each class is capped at 15 to 20 participants to maintain an impactful teacher to student ratio. Cycles last 12 weeks, or four weeks in the summer, and CASAS post-tests are administered to each student upon completion of a cycle. Students can then register for higher level classes if they have increased their English abilities as determined by a CASAS test.As indicated, an award from DGLF will support our pilot ESOL hybrid class model for advanced learners. This instruction model will allow for more flexibility in students' schedules and increase the retention rate. Participants will access class material online once a week, with the other classes conducted in-person in the classroom. This model will not only strengthen learners' English language skills but will also enhance their knowledge of the internet and technology. These skills are critical as students search and apply for job opportunities online. As technology and computer skills are often prerequisites for employment, this ultimately helps students integrate into the American workforce.","In accordance with Teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages and Maryland State Department of Education standards, Catholic Charities offers 12-week class cycles in the spring, fall, and winter, and an additional four-week intensive summer cycle. Students in the non-intensive cycles receive instruction in the evenings from 6:30PM-8:30PM two times each week, totaling four hours of weekly class time or 48 hours per cycle. For the summer intensive cycle, learners attend class from 6:30PM-8:30PM Monday through Thursday. This equates to eight hours of instruction per week and 32 total hours over the duration of the cycle. In this short time, enrollees will complete two levels of ESOL courses and can then continue their studies in the fall.In addition to the regularly scheduled classes, three-and-a-half-hour beginner and intermediate sessions have been created on Saturdays for individuals who cannot attend classes during the week. Employment conflicts tend to be the most common reason for choosing this class. Each student will receive over 120 hours of instruction, assuming they progress through the beginner, intermediate, and advanced level classes.","The Catholic Charities ESOL program utilizes CASAS evaluation software to assess student education gains. This system allows us to track progress across all ESOL courses at Catholic Charities, gather data, and use that data to identify possible areas of improvement. Pre-tests are administered to students entering the program to determine their existing English language proficiency. Based upon the results of the pre-test, students are placed into the appropriate level class that best corresponds with their English abilities. Upon completion of a course cycle, a CASAS post-test is administered, and the results are compared to those from the pre-test. This side-by-side comparison provides a very clear image of the progress that the student has made over the course cycle. Furthermore, if it is found that the student did not meet proficiency requirements for a certain curriculum area, the program can address this deficiency before the student advances to the next level class.In addition to the CASAS evaluation software, the ESOL staff also track specific student objectives that our learners identify as wanting to work on through our classes. Examples of objectives include being able to speak to family members in English, writing a resume, completing an employment application, and reading their child's report card, among others. By setting concrete goals, students more clearly realize their language gains and feel more confident putting them to use in real world situations.","Catholic Charities' ESOL program has operated continuously for 26 years, and we remain committed to sustaining this program and the critical services it provides to the community. Our ESOL program operates under an annual budget that accounts for all program expenses, including facilities, equipment, and supplies. For facilities, we hold classes at three locations in Gaithersburg, MD: at Catholic Charities' Spanish Catholic Center; at St. Martin of Tours Elementary School, which has donated their space to the program free of charge; and at Gaithersburg Middle School, where we pay for the learning spaces. Each site is centrally located and accessible by public transportation. Catholic Charities continuously seeks funding from diverse sources to uphold sustainability. All programs benefit from the efforts of the agency's Development Department, which pursues individual, corporate, foundation, and government support through direct mail, special events, solicitation and stewardship, and grant and contract proposals. We also have a long history of effectively managing grants and contracts from federal, state, and local government entities. Furthermore, we leverage non-financial resources to maximize program effectiveness. Over 7,000 individuals volunteered for the organization during FY 2018, providing over $20 million of pro bono services. We also receive in-kind support (e.g., donations of food, clothing, and furniture) from countless community members. ","Catholic Charities aims to provide innovative instructional methods that enhance students' learning experience and allow them the opportunity to increase their digital literacy and technology skills. Technology plays a key role in our ESOL instruction, as the book series that we use (Step Forward from Oxford University Press) requires that learners download an application on their smart phones or computers. During the first two weeks of classes, our instructors provide students with directions on how to log in and access the Oxford webpage and guide students in using the online materials. The instructors are available to provide additional, individualized assistance as needed to help students increase their aptitude in using technology. Each of our instructional sites is equipped with WiFi internet access. The program also has one projector that instructors may reserve and use, however, teachers bring their own laptops to each class. DGLF funding will be used to purchase a second projector. We currently have 11 Google Chromebooks available for students' use in the classroom, which allows for a 15:11 student to technology ratio. Oftentimes students must share Chromebooks during class due to lack of availability. Support from DGLF would allow us to purchase five additional Chromebooks, lowering the average student to technology ratio to 1:1 and thereby allowing all students to work independently. The average age of the Chromebooks is one year.",Yes,"Further integrating technology into our ESOL instructional methods will allow students to build their technology skills in multiple ways. While many students are proficient in accomplishing tasks on a touchscreen smartphone or tablet, they may not show the same proficiency on a device with a physical keyboard. Class time spent utilizing the Chromebooks has helped students improve their functional computer skills and overall ability to use the internet wisely. Many students have reported that our classes represent the first time they have ever had access to a computer and express their excitement at finally being able to use one. Students will also be better prepared to use technology to seek employment, such as creating resumes and submitting online job applications. The availability of technology will enable students to be more productive and proactive in their job search and has allowed them to become more competitive candidates when searching for jobs online. The use of technology will also lead to increased rates of retention by creating open lines of communication between students, instructors, and program staff. Timely communication allows for scheduling flexibility, allowing more students to complete classes rather than choose between work or class. The proper use of smart phones has helped students in becoming more efficient and responsive to others.","$368,593.00 ","$304,121.00 ","Catholic Charities respectfully requests a grant of $15,000 from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation to support its ESOL program in Gaithersburg, MD. Funds will be used to purchase five Chromebooks for use in class instruction. At $200 each, $1,000 of the proposed grant funding will be allocated to purchasing these computers, creating a 1:1 student to technology ratio for our program. $12,420 of the remaining $14,000 would be used to fund instructor salaries. $1,080 will be allocated to renting two classrooms at Gaithersburg Middle School. The last $500 will be used to purchase a second projector for the program. There are have been several occasions in the past where multiple teachers have wanted to use our one projector for instruction, meaning some classes have had to go without a projector due to lack of availability. Adding a second projector would alleviate this issue. Together, these items will allow the ESOL program to acquire sufficient resources for implementing the hybrid class model.

In stark contrast to those with a high school diploma averaging10.3% above the poverty line.,"The Southeast Iowa region has the largest number of adults (139,734) without a highschool diploma and the Central Iowa region has the second largest number of adults (57,458).",,"There are 526 full and part-time personnel working in adult education programs funded by the state. 82.5% are instructors and 69% are part-time. In addition, 42% of all personnel are less than or within one year of experience in adult education. This percentage continues to climb with AEL personnel shifting to other educational pathways that offer full-time employment. By serving the needs of the instructors this project will influence the instruction of 11,000 AEL participants annually. ","The Adult Basic Education Instructor Pathway Program is a project that will not only provide a ""ladder"" for career pathway development of AEL instructors but also the opportunity for AEL providers to integrate it with local level mentoring. Through the direct involvement with statewide AEL instructors -- targeting the large group of new, inexperienced instructors, this project will, offer on-demand training modules to allow for customized paths for instructors.The project will serve 3 cohorts of instructors with 20 participants in each cohort (60 instructors across the state). Follow-up with 3-4 focus groups with 10 participants. In addition, the project will present and engage with 200 instructors with online webinars to highlight the project and recruit additional new instructors.  For each cohort of instructors, data will be collected to compare the performance of student participation results (percentage of post-test rate and measurable skill gains) against non-participants. This analysis will be used for continuous improvement. The credentialing process will track completers and match that information with the classes taught and students directly served. Of the 60 instructors credentialed through the three cohorts it is expected that the project will impact the services offered to a conservative estimate of over 720 students (based on each instructor (60) offering one class with 12 participants). ","By providing identifiable career paths, AEL instructors will be vested in their training opportunities to assist with retention plans, and coaching for new AEL instructors. This work is critical for the direct services to better serve our AEL participants, those seeking their high school equivalency as well as building basic literacy skills. Instructors must be better prepared to move into  new roles that fit with the skills required for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) adult education and literacy program. This dramatic shift in the requirements for AEL services and the skill set of the AEL instructor causes a risk in achieving the educational outcomes for participants. Having a standardized approach to introducing key elements of AEL instruction across the state to ensure quality pathways for AEL instructors is aimed at raising the level of achievement with participants, retain instructors and streamline the onboarding process for AEL providers. This project will: 1)	Create content for a New Instructor Training course, delivered through a learning management system which IDOE has negotiated with a key partner, the Iowa Community College Online Consortium. 2)	Pilot the facilitation of the training by recruiting statewide participation to provide feedback through focus groups with instructors. 3)	Provide credentialing of digital badges awarded by the Iowa Literacy Council with endorsement sought by IDOE.","The Adult Basic Education Instructor Pathway Program will build off the process of the volunteer training of the Iowa's Amercorp program, Educate and Elevate which is set to start May 2019.

","The instructors will use the Iowa approved assessments, which includes the CASAS assessment and the TABE for correctional participants. The project will compare the cohort of instructors that participated against a control group to measure the post-test rate as well as the educational gains achieved among the AEL participants served. This data will be used to support further analysis among cohorts of instructors with 1-3 years of AEL experience. In addition, a survey of job satisfaction of AEL instructors will be conducted annually to access the average wage rate, the condition of paid time for lesson preparation and professional development participation, as well as their satisfaction with engagement. A 2012 Deloitte survey, Talent 2020, found that when employees were asked to indicate the top factors that would cause them to look for new employment over the next 12 months, lack of career progress topped the list.","This project will include facilities at a multitude of campuses.

The unemployment rate for immigrants arriving in 2010 or later is 5.6% (US Census: American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017). EDG targets newly arrived immigrants. On average over 60% of EDG's students have not found their first job at time of enrollment.,"In 2010, 56% of Massachusetts immigrants enrolling in MA Dept. of Education funded ESOL classes dropped out before completing the ESOL level they started. (Breaking The Language Barrier, The Boston Foundation 2011 p.58)EDG's drop out rate is less than 10%. This is due to the program's intensive design (9-20 hours/week) that allows students to complete one level in only 12 weeks. Immigrants often drop out because job and family pressures make it difficult to come to school.","The American Community Survey (2013-2017) identifies the poverty rate of Boston immigrants arriving in 2010 or later as 25.8%.The poverty rate for Boston area immigrants from South America is 17.6%, the Caribbean 26%, and Asia 29%. (Boston Immigrant Labor Force, Boston Planning & Development Agency 1/2018 p.41). Immigrants who are not English proficient fare worse. Their median wage is $29,185 (p.32) while a Boston living wage is pegged at $31,736. (MIT Living Wage Calculator)","According to the US Census Bureau 84,026 MA adults do not speak English at all (2012-2016 American Community Survey) and 55,368 of Boston immigrants in the labor force are not English proficient (Boston Planning & Research, 1/2018 p8).9 of the top 10 countries of origin for Boston's 2016 immigrants are not English speaking. They include China, Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, Cape Verde, Vietnam, Colombia, India and Guatemala. They accounted for 56% of Boston newcomers (BPDA, 9/2018).",,"EDG will serve at least 80 immigrants in 3 levels of ESOL classes: Low Beginner, High Beginner, and Intermediate. We also provide counseling services to guide students and graduates in areas as easy as getting a library card, as scary as completing a job application, and as daunting as applying to college. EDG expects students to make a measureable significant learning gain and to take the next steps toward accomplishing their identified employment, job training and/or education goals.","EDG's measureable program objectives include:Retention: 80 immigrants will enroll and 72 will compete at least one level of ESOL. In addition, 30 students who enroll at the low or high beginner levels will also complete a more advanced class at EDG. 10 who complete the low beginner will advance to the high beginner and 20 who complete the high beginner will move on to the advanced class. Learner Gains: At least 52 students will make a significant learning gain as defined by the MA Department of Elementary and Secondary Education by increasing their SPL score 33 or more points as measured by the Best Plus standardized test.EDG follows students for up to 2 years after they leave the program and for 6 years for those that go on to college. We expect:Employment: 42 students will be employed within one year of graduation.Education: 14 EDG graduates will continue to advanced ESOL classes, college prep programs and/or community college, or job training programs within 18 months of leaving EDG.","EDG's raison d'etre is to accelerate the pace of English acquisition in newly arrived immigrants so they can become participating and productive members of their new community. EDG's Accelerated English Plus classes are designed to offer 9-20 hours of instruction a week because studies and our own experience have shown that intensity increases the pace of progress. Our classes are small (10-14 students) so as to maximize student participation and to allow for individual attention.EDG makes use proven strategies to accelerate learning including: total physical response, native language support, and cooperative learning. We use a variety of methods and materials. Students practice listening and speaking by playing games, having conversations in small groups and taking field trips to become acquainted with the Greater Boston area. We also blend classroom and internet based learning. Online tools enable self-paced, independent learning which also helps students to continue acquiring English once they graduate.Students' ownership of their learning also facilitates progress. Students are encouraged to monitor their progress by keeping track of what they have learned and what they need to study. Above all, EDG strives to provide a warm and nurturing atmosphere where students are respected, supported and encouraged. Such an environment is conducive to learning. It mitigates factors that impede learning such as fear of failure, anxiety, and lack of self-confidence.","In 2019, EDG will run three 12-week cycles: winter, spring, and fall. The winter session runs from 1/7/19 to 3/29/19, the spring session will run from 4/22/19 to 7/12/19 and the fall session from 9/16/19 to 12/13/19. Each cycle is preceded by a week of orientation and followed by a week of evaluation.Low beginner students will complete 108 hours of instruction per 12-week session.High beginner students will complete 204 hours of instruction per 12-week session.Intermediate students will complete 192 hours of instruction per 12-week session.All students meet with the Educational & Career Advisor at least 3 times to discuss career options and prepare a road map indicating each step they have to take to accomplish their goals. We help each student prepare a rÃ©sumÃ© and offer job placement assistance, and educational referrals. Students who need advanced ESOL or job training are referred to other agencies.The advisor also assists qualified students fill out college applications, financial aid documents and credential evaluation applications in a timely manner.EDG also runs a Resource Center for students and graduates. Past students come back for conversation practice. They come for help with homework, job and school applications, immigration paperwork, and just to visit. We maintain an open computer lab which students use for job searches, completing employment and educational applications, online learning or just to email, Facebook and/or Skype family and friends.","EDG keeps careful records to measure if we are meeting the goals described in the previous section.1. Attendance: Attendance is taken daily and entered into EDG's student database. Attendance and retention are indicators of relevant instruction and the teachers and program director review this information weekly.2. Learner Gains: The standardized Best Plus test measures learner gains and is given to all students at the beginning and end of each session by a certified test administrator.3. Improvement in Life Skills: Teachers keep skill inventory sheets on each student. Check marks are placed next to the skills the student has learned. Skills include computer and internet basics, continuing to learn English on your own, health and nutrition, budgeting and saving, and avoiding financial scams.4. Post Placement: The Educational & Career Advisor records what employment, job training and college applications are submitted and what programs students are admitted into. The Advisor follows students by face-to-face meetings, phone conversations, and/or email exchanges.We also use student feedback to make improvements. At the end of each session students complete evaluations. In the past students have asked for more pronunciation practice. We added afternoon conversation practice with mentors.During weekly staff meetings and yearly planning sessions we evaluate how the program has helped students progress toward their goals and what improvements can be made.","EDG's central location at 434 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, is convenient to bus and subway transportation. The location allows EDG to attract immigrants from many countries who have settled in different Boston area neighborhoods. The diversity of our students reflects the diversity of area immigrants and allows EDG to confront stereotypes by teaching mutual respect, understanding and cooperation. In the last ten years EDG students have come from 46 different countries. At EDG they share customs and cultures.The Mass Ave location has 2 classrooms, tutoring space and 2 computer labs. In addition we have office space for individual testing and counseling. Teachers have their own desk and desktop computer. The supply room has a multifunctional (print, copy, scan) networked copier. We have 3 additional printers, one is color.All computers have high-speed internet connections and WiFi is available throughout EDG.All the classrooms have whiteboards and teachers have access to a projector.The Low Beginner class meets in a state of the art classroom space donated by Northeastern University that is a short walk from our Mass Ave location.","EDG's two computer labs each have 7 Dell desktop computers that run Windows 8 Professional. In one lab the computers are seven years old and in the other lab they are five years old. All computers are well maintained and in good working order. EDG admits 36 students per session for a desktop computer ratio of 2.5 students/computer. When we use the computers, the class is divided in half and one group works at the computers while the other stays with the teacher. We teach basic computer literacy and use online English learning programs including Quizlet, Oxford Picture Dictionary, and USALearns.We also have a laptop dedicated to Best Plus testing.In the last two years we have made increased use of tablets. We have 21 Samsung Tablets that are 2 years old and 6 iPads. Three iPads are 4th Generation (2015), and three are iPad Air (2016). Each student gets their own tablet during class time to access lessons, homework and quizzes using Google Docs. They can also use their own smart phones, in class and outside to complete assignments.In addition, EDG partners with English InnovationsÂ® and Tech Goes Home. English InnovationsÂ® couples learning English with digital literacy and allows for classroom learning to be supplemented with self-paced independent study. The program requires each student to get a loaned tablet during class time.Tech Goes Home allows EDG students to purchase a new tablet or Chromebook for $50 after completing 15 hours of digital literacy.",No,,"$177,100.00 ","$177,100.00 ","As noted above, the total Accelerated English Plus program budget is $177,100.

Instructors follow one of two curriculums: ""Ventures"" from Cambridge University Press or ""Stand Out"" from National Geographic Learning.Citizenship preparation classes:Classes are held at International House. They are designed to help students pass the U.S. naturalization interview and test. Instructors use the textbook ""Citizenship: Passing the Test"" by Lynn Weintraub and federal publications such as the N-400 Application for Naturalization. Given the large amount of information, the program also provides students with individual tutors before each class.Family literacy events: These events are designed to help immigrant families participate in their child's education. At Sterling Elementary School, we teach parents and guardians how to actively read with their children in Spanish and English. We also host book fairs to help families create home libraries.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in Trenton is currently 3%. This does not offer a full picture, as many Trenton residents may be underemployed or working multiple jobs yet still unable to make a living wage. Latinas Unidas offers ESL education to adult students to strengthen their English literacy skills - skills that are essential in finding and keeping employment. ","In Trenton NJ, the drop-out rate is 40% based on statistics from the State of New Jersey School Performance report. Trenton's graduation and post-secondary performance significantly lags in comparison to schools across the state. ","According to the most recent data from the US Census Bureau, 27% of Trenton residents live in poverty. ","According to the Trenton Literacy Movement, a non-profit dedicated to youth literacy in Trenton, 70% of school age children in Trenton do not read at grade level. This is seriously detrimental to Trenton  since children who cannot read by 4th Grade are more at risk of ""School to Prison Pipeline"". This is the disproportionate tendency of disadvantaged youth to become incarcerated due to disconnection from school. These youth then become adults with little education and job skills. ",,"Funding will provide ESL  for 50 adult students in Latinas Unidas. ESL classes will focus on four basic language skills: listening, speaking, reading comprehension and writing. Instruction will be provided 10 months per year for 12 hours per wee. Outcomes for students are to find jobs, obtain promotion to gain self-sufficiency; gain the ability to communicate with community officials; become more involved in their children's education: obtain their GED, and become a citizen.  ","Latinas Unidas serves over 130 students each year. We have found that ESL students need more advanced conversational instruction to help them navigate job search and the employment process. This grant will allow us to continue ESL advanced classes geared at these students who need more intense education in English conversation that is directly translatable to their employment status. Students need support in speaking with prospective employers for interviews, inquiries, and once they are hired, in communicating their needs as employees. This level of support was made possible last year through Dollar General and we are seeking support again this year to help students. Adult students typically stay in the program for 30-60 hours of instruction; however, students need 100-150 hours of instruction to advance at least one grade level. By expanding our ESL advanced classes, we will be able to focus on the four basic language skills: listening, speaking, reading comprehension and writing. Specific goals are to 1) become employed or obtain better employment to enhance self-sufficiency, 2) gain the ability to communicate with officials and social service workers to obtain needed services, 3) become more involved in their children's education 4) obtain their GED, and 5) become a citizen. We project 50 students served and of those 20 will gain employment, 5 will obtain US Citizenship, and 2 will get their GED.","ESL Advanced classes will continue to run Monday through Thursday. Classes are slotted from 9 am to noon. The classes will offer students a variety of different ways to learn including:*	Extensive practice in listening, speaking, reading and writing in the classroom.*	Students' work includes group projects done periodically throughout the class along with small presentations to help them with public speaking and pronunciation of the English language.*	Hands-on experience working with computers to complete assigned class work and assignments.Teacher works with the students to provide a variety of creative methods for learning including group and individual projects and presentations. The teachers work to implement the English language into each area of the students' lives helping them prepare for real-life situations. As a result the students have less fear using the English language in public settings","The project period for this grant is July 2019 through June 2020. A fall and spring session will be offered for ESL advanced classes. Classes will run 4x a week (Mon-Thurs) for 3 hours each class.

Upon entering the program, we perform in-house pre-test to determine the level of a students English language knowledge. We also administer Best Literacy Assessment required for all students at the start and end of each class term. In addition, there are quizzes administrated on a regular basis and exams given at the end of each unit. These combine all concepts learned within that period. Mid-term and final exams dictate a large percentage of the student's overall grade. These tools help us measure quantitatively the exact impact of the program.

We implement a custom-made, individualized curriculum to help women develop skills tested in the TABE and HiSET. Depending on their educational levels, we expect women to improve their reading and math skills and/or complete the HiSET.","Formerly incarcerated black women experience a 43.6 percent unemployment rate (versus 35.2 percent for black men). One of the surest means to gain employment and social mobility is education. Yet black women of all ages, many from the LGBTQ community, are frequently neglected before, during, and after incarceration. Poverty, trauma, and family responsibilities often interrupt these women's educational paths before they are incarcerated. In jails and prisons, existing programs are limited, focusing more on entry-level job readiness than literacy and math skills. Operation Restoration is committed to help formerly incarcerated women pursue the kind of education they need to truly better their lives. Each year, OR's Women FIRST Clinic enrolls 60 currently and formerly incarcerated women in our HiSET courses. Thirty women attend our classes at OR's office in Central City and thirty attend at the Orleans Justice Center (the local jail, more commonly known as Orleans Parish Prison, or OPP). Our ultimate aim is to help each of our students pass the HiSET. More immediately, we identify, address, and seek to improve each student's lowest scoring math, reading, and language skills on the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE).","When a woman first enrolls in the Women FIRST Clinic, our Director of Social Services determines what resources she needs to facilitate her education. We provide transportation to the Clinic and childcare and snacks on site, anticipating and removing common barriers to class attendance. Our Education Program Coordinator also conducts an intake survey addressing the incoming student's educational history and goals.Each student takes the TABE (Test of Adult Basic Learning), allowing our teacher to create an individualized education plan based on the skills each student needs most to develop. We divide skills into three categories: Target (score less than 70 %), Mid-Range (70-80%), or Solid (100%). Our curriculum writer develops materials to teach and test these specific skills at a variety of levels. For example, if a student tests at a 6.2 grade level in Reading, and one Target Skill is Recalling Information, the curriculum developer provides resources addressing that particular combination.Aided by tutors, the teacher records the skills students work on each class period, retesting these skills every month and recording students' scores. (We employ one tutor for every two students to provide more one-on-one attention). In this way, we can pinpoint students' needs, carefully track their progress, and help them reach their educational goals.","While students' timelines for improving their reading and math skills and/or passing the HiSET vary according to their initial educational levels, we do seek measurable improvement toward their goals over the course of one year. At the Central City location, the Clinic year consists of four sessions, each of which is three months in duration. At the outset of each session, a cohort of ten (10) students meets twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays) for a two hour class (5 to 7 PM), which consists primarily of math and reading instruction. As each session reaches a conclusion, a new cohort of ten women enters the Clinic, but students from previous cohorts may continue to attend as long as they wish to attain their educational goals. In this way, Operation Restoration provides a total of 208 instructional hours to each of the thirty women we serve in the community each year.At OPP, classes meet once a week on Wednesday evenings (8 to 9:30 PM). Ten women attend each class on a rotating basis. Jail populations are highly transient, so some women attend the class for months, others only for weeks. Each year, we serve approximately thirty different women in this institution, providing a total of 78 instructional hours to each woman. ","The TABE 11 serves as our initial baseline determination of students' skill levels. Our lead teacher's individualized lesson plans chart each student's Target Skills (score 70% or below) and delineate the materials used each class session to address or reinforce those skills. Each of our curriculum designer's lessons for specific skill sets also include tests to evaluate whether a student has attained and retained those skills post-instruction. Per TABE guidelines, we only administer version 12 after 3 months, or 60 hours, of instruction.","Operation Restoration has two classrooms: one small (seats 8) and one large (seats 30). We purchase notebooks, pens, and pencils for each student for each three-month session. We have the ability to print worksheets and other resources for every class. Our classroom supplies also include manipulatives, like interlocking counting blocks, to provide students a hands-on learning experience.",We have four desktop computers on which students complete the TABE. We also have a class set of 25 Chromebooks on which students watch instructional videos and complete writing assignments.,No,,"$57,000.00 ","$15,000.00 ","Operation Restoration would use funds from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation primarily to hire and retain qualified educational professionals for the Women FIRST Clinic. Stephanie Gaskill is currently serving as our lead teacher, but as she transitions into the Education Director role, we will need to hire a new teacher to take her place. We pay our lead teacher $20/hour (the going rate for local community college HiSET instructors) for a total of $80 per week (two classes, two hours each) for a total of $4160 per year. Our curriculum developer will continue to provide new resources as needed, working approximately 2 hours per week at $20/hour for a yearly cost of $2080. We also need to hire a literacy specialist for two students who have particular difficulty reading. We would pay this specialist $40 per class ($80 per week) for a total of $4160 per year. The rest of the funds would be used for support services. Because the transportation costs we pay for our students totals over $10,000 per year, we are requesting the maximum $500 this grant allows for transportation.

The Georgia Department of Labor reports that the unemployment rate in the Northwest Georgia Region in December 2018 was 3.9%. FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) reports an unemployment rate of 4.2% in Gilmer County in December 2018. ","Per the Georgia Dept. of Education Gilmer County's 2018 graduation rate was 83.8%, though only 66% of those entering 9th grade in 2014 graduated from the high school in 2018, the rest dropping out or transferring to other schools, primarily the local evening school or home school. The 2018 graduation rate at the evening school was 13.1% Taking account of students who transferred out from Gilmer High School who then failed to graduate, the drop-out rate in Gilmer can be estimated to be about 25%.",The US Census Bureau estimates the poverty level in Gilmer in 2018 to be 14.4%. The Kids Count Data Center estimates that 25.9% of Gilmer children in 2017 lived in poverty and 37% of children in Gilmer in 2017 lived in families with income under 150% of the poverty threshold. ,"A 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy reported 18% of Gilmer adults lack basic literacy skills. 6.6% of Gilmer residents are foreign born (mostly Latino). 34% of foreign-born Latinos speak English proficiently (Pew). If the literacy level in Gilmer corresponds to data on Gilmer adults without high school diplomas (2018 half of 2003), the current percentage of Gilmer adults lacking literacy skills is around 9%, or a bit higher when the growing non-native-born population is factored in.",,"220 students will be served during the grant year, 85 in Adult Basic Education, 45 in Adult Secondary Education/GED-prep, 90 in English as a Second Language. At least 35 ESL students will advance the equivalent of at least 3 grade levels during the funding period. At least 20 ABE students will advance to ASE during the funding period. At least 10 ASE students will pass at least one subject of the GED test and at least 5 ASE students will pass all four subjects of the GED test.","'Learning Opens Doors' targets adults walled off from opportunities due to lack of a high school diploma or English proficiency. This ongoing project demands adjustment each step of the way. For example, we began with grand hopes for an intervention with people in our local jail, going to the jail to provide GED-prep instruction. Scores of inmates were engaged, but in the end not engaged, not a single person opting to continue learning after release from jail. That part of our project was therefore suspended. Other parts thrive. A collaboration with Chattahoochee Technical College provides GED-prep classes 8 hours weekly. We target serving 25 students in these classes. 105 students wanting to prepare for the GED test but unable to commit to the CTC classes will continue to learn via internet-based instructional programs, under the direct supervision of an instructor. English as a Second Language classes are conducted 4 evenings weekly. At least 45 students will participate in these classes, another 45 students then learning via internet-based ESL programs, under direct supervision of an instructor. 20 ESL students who are parents will take part in a literacy effort spearheaded by the local school system, which targets children aged 0-5, participation by our ESL students providing a multi-generational component. These parents will be provided books to read to their children and our ESL class will prepare the parents for the readings.","New ABE/ASE/GED-track students are assessed via the intake assessment tool incorporated in the PLATO program, which establishes each student's grade-level starting point and prescribes a learning path to GED-readiness. New participants in the CTC GED-prep classes are assessed by TABE testing, which also identifies grade levels. ESL students are assessed via TABE as well. Students fully new to English either join a beginner's ESL class or are assigned to the Pumarosa program in order to learn basic English skills prior to joining a class. Participants in the CTC GED-prep classes are reassessed on TABE after every 30 hours of instruction, as a way to monitor progress. Progress by students using PLATO for GED-prep is automatically tracked within that program and regularly monitored by staff, in conjunction with each student. Once prescribed a learning path in PLATO, the student progresses on that path through self-paced, computer software-based instruction, with one-on-one instructor support. Each program requires a student to pass a mastery test before progressing to the next level of lessons. Students' grade-level progress is tracked a minimum monthly, with customized instructor intervention and/or extra assignments implemented on an as-needed basis. When a GED-prep student approaches readiness for the GED test, practice GED tests in PLATO and/or GED.com are used to confirm readiness or to identify areas still needing instruction prior to taking the GED test.","The project is ongoing. Outcomes will be met by the end of this grant year and progress measured monthly. Students in classes offered by Chattahoochee Tech will have two weekly 4-hour sessions. They are required to attend at least 6 hours per week. All other students are encouraged to work at least 3 hours weekly. An operating principle of the GLC is to empower each student in any decision about the pace of learning. Each student decides when, within the parameter of GLC's operating hours, to learn, how long to stay at the GLC while learning, and how frequently to come. No student will ever be given a minimal instruction time requirement. Students however are advised that successful outcomes require at least 3 hours work weekly and are urged to meet this 'soft' requirement. Students meet with staff monthly to review progress, identify barriers to progress and strategies for surmounting the barriers. One metric used in the monthly tracking of progress toward accomplishing stated outcomes will be each student's weekly instructional hour total, and staff will intervene with students who are not progressing sufficiently due to this metric. When transportation to and from the GLC prevents regular study, the GLC offers to pay for a transportation service. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the internet learning platforms by studying away from the GLC and at times the GLC is not open, though warned not to do so to the detriment of direct instructor support.","1) Enrollment---Enrollment is measured monthly to gauge progress and at the end of the year to show achievement.2) Participation---Students' hours are measured monthly, to show a student's likelihood of achieving outcomes.3) Individual Student Progress/Achievement---ABE/ASE/GED students using PLATO as the core source of instruction are assessed initially in the areas of language arts, reading, and math, establishing a student's starting grade level in these areas. An Individual Progress Report shows grade-level progress by the student working on a prescribed learning path and is reviewed monthly and at the end of the funding period, to measure progress from ABE to ASE levels and from ASE to GED readiness levels. Students working in science and social studies are tracked similarly. Students participating in the Chattahoochee Tech GED-prep classes are initially assessed by TABE, then reassessed in TABE after every 30 hours of instruction, to track progress. Readiness for the actual GED test in a given subject is assessed via GED practice tests in PLATO and via the official GED practice tests available on GED.com. GED completion is measured by actual successful completion of the GED test. Progress by newcomer ESL students is measured weekly and monthly by direct instructor observation of progress (the Pumarosa program produces no reports). Progress by students in ESL classes is measured by periodical TABE testing, along with with direct instructor observation of progress.","Gilmer Learning Center occupies a county-owned facility of 2,630 sq.ft. The facility has one separate classroom, one large meeting/study/classroom with 10 computer stations and a 'classroom' area, and two small study rooms with 5 computer stations each. The GLC also has 6 notebook computers which can supplement desk computers. The facility contains four bathrooms and a full kitchen. 2 office spaces provide opportunity for private counseling of students and private tutoring. The facility is conveniently located near downtown Ellijay, the seat of Gilmer County and central to the surrounding county area. GLC obtained this location via a 1995 Appalachian Regional Commission grant to Gilmer County to build a new Health Department and house the GLC in the old Health Department building. ","Historically the GLC's learning model has relied predominantly on open entry/open exit, self-paced, computer software-based learning with one-on-one over-the-shoulder instructor support. While a formal classroom model has recently been added to the GLC toolbox, the historical model retains its importance at the GLC.  Because of this, technology in the form of computer hardware and software is an essential component of GLC's operations. Very old equipment has been completely replaced. The GLC currently utilizes a combination of 10 chromebox-based computer stations and six chromebooks. Chattahoochee Technical College has added 10 Dell desktop computer stations.

Individualized tutoring is an effective method for adult learners because lessons can be tailored to the students' skill levels and goals.  At each student's first appointment, they receive a comprehensive intake assessment, which includes the TABE locator test, Ventures Placement Test, or an Oral Assessment test for students who are non-speakers of English, to determine their starting skill levels and to set professional and personal goals. Each student is matched with the tutor that is best suited to help the student reach their goals, and the student is assigned appropriate educational materials based on their skill levels. The student's one-on-one relationship with their tutor helps to promote attendance, accountability, and perseverance, and ultimately leads the student to educational success.

Past research has demonstrated that prison writing programs provide participants with the literary skills, self-confidence, on-the-job learning ability, and enhanced capacity for communication and self-expression that increases the preparedness of incarcerated individuals for successful reentry into society and decrease recidivism by as much as 60 percent (PEW Tracking Study 2015).The Prison Writes Initiative adds tremendous value to the State Penitentiary's GED program. These values include: (1) enhancing GED test-score performance; (2) increasing GED completion rates; (3) expanding the overall level of participation in the prison's GED program by attracting and maintaining the involvement of individuals who were not previously enrolled in the prison GED program (as many as 30 percent in past PWI programs); (4) preparing release inmates for successful jod placement, on-the-job learning and/or higher academic achievement (by fostering the self-confidence and communication skills required in the world outside the prison); and (5) decreasing rates of recidivism.  ","The classes provided by the VOX Prison Writes Initiatives are modeled after university-style workshops, offering students an alternating balance of direct instruction, facilitated classroom discussion and individual creative assignments. Each week begins with the assignment of readings in literary and non-fiction texts identified by the instructor, followed by group discussions and interpretations of the respective materials. Readings and discussions are then followed by creative writing assignments related to the type of literature (fiction, non-fiction, poetry) represented in that week's reading and discussion. Through the repeated process of reading, group discussion and personal expression, students are encouraged to develop technical and creative skills that are informed by both their exposure to and interpretation of traditional literature and their creative reflection on their own personal interests and experiences. The structure of our classes has proven to be highly beneficial, both in improving reading scores and enhancing writing skills.  ","Classes for the Prison Writes Initiative will meet once a week for 3 hours per class over a two-semester period -- from September 1, 2019 to June 1, 2020. This represents a total of 18 in-class hours per week for each of the 6 classes. ","To measure incremental improvement in reading comprehension and writing, participants will be given a sequence of reading and writing tests. Our results in the area of reading writing improvements will be based on the combination of findings using measurements from the reading-comprehension sections of the TABE study guide and the observed improvements from a 3-phased evaluation process administered to students by the program instructor over the course of each semester. An initial set of evaluations will be administered at the beginning of the term to test participants' reading and writing competency. At the middle of the term, another assessment will be administered to identify their strengths and weaknesses compared to the previous findings. At the end of each term, a final evaluation will be taken to determine the amount of material learned during the length of the program.Quantitative records to correlate program participation with individual test-score performance and completion rates will be maintained and reported on a yearly basis GED participation levels. Research from past programs has demonstrated a positive relationship between program participation and successful GED completion, with program participants 20 percent more likely to pass the general GED examination on the first try and 40 percent more likely to pass the examination on their second attempt.For participates in post-program impact measurements, tracking records will be administered.

Classes operate throughout the year with supplemental classes, programs, and activities as needed. An annual graduation ceremony takes place the second week in June. ","Students in the GED Program are tested using the TABE (Tests of Adult Basic Education). Practice tests determine learning gains from classroom instruction and are administered at regular intervals to ascertain knowledge and skills before students take the actual four on-line GED tests. Students in the ESL Program use the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) standardized exams. When measuring progress, TLC compares students' pretest scores with their post test results. Post-test scores indicate if a student moved from a lower level to a higher level.

As a result of instruction and coaching provided through our free classes, students will become more confident in their math, writing, reading, social studies, and science abilities. The primary outcome of the program is for students to obtain their HiSET degree and become more confident. ","The main objective of the Empowering Adult Learners Program is that students will show gains in knowledge in math, literacy, writing, science, and social studies. Some students will earn their HiSET as a result of the program. Our goal is that 15 students will earn their HiSET. We had 12 students pass in 2018 and have already had two pass in 2019. We will measure outcomes through pre and post tests with CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System) testing.  ","The Empowering Adult Learners Program is designed with an open class format where adult learners can receive individualized instruction from our Adult Education Director and volunteers (most are retired teachers). In this informal environment, students feel more at ease facing challenges and feel a sense of community with one another since they are all working to achieve the same goal. During class, students meet three days a week for two to three hours a day working to prepare for the five different subject tests of the HiSET. When students seem ready in a particular area (for example, science), our Education Director encourages them to go ahead and take that test. Students gain more confidence as they pass tests and then can come back and work on subjects that they might not be as strong in. Our students use IXL.com to practice math skills, Essential Education to practice literacy skills and more, and New Readers Press for access to online current events that are written at levels students can comprehend. News issues are then discussed within the group to facilitate critical thinking and work on communication skills. The design of the program helps meet the purpose and objectives because we are providing a safe and comfortable place where adult learners feel good attending. One of the biggest hurdles adult learners face is feeling embarrassed or not confident in their abilities to improve their skills. The design of our program allows students to feel at ease.

In 2018, IRWP's 384 students were from 51 areas/countries. The ten largest demographic groups' areas of origin were Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mexico, Somalia, Syria, Turkey, and Vietnam.  69% of students served had children in the 5th grade or younger; for these parents, increasing involvement in their children's education to help them succeed academically is a primary goal. 12% of students had no prior schooling in their area of origin and 19% had 1-6 years of education. These students face extra challenges in obtaining the English and life skills necessary for daily tasks, basic communication, and the potential to provide for their families.

Volunteers are involved in the process of reviewing potential students with staff. After choosing the best potential they accompany staff to an initial meeting. Staff assesses the student skill level and tailors curriculum based upon this and personal goals, prior education, and specific needs. All materials, lesson plans, and ongoing training/support are provided to the teacher and student. Classes are held in the homes of the students for two hours per week, typically in two one-hour sessions, with independent study assigned between meetings. We talk with teachers any time that they need support but also connect at least once a month to get class reports and stories of challenges and success. Staff regularly visits students to touch base, solicit their feelings on their classes, evaluate changes in their confidence, and track over time their willingness and ability to use their new skills handle daily living tasks independently. Students and teachers also can take field trips together in the community to practice in a specific area (such as a grocery store or bank) or to fun places of interest to practice speaking skills and aid the student in feeling less isolated and more connected.","Outcomes will be accomplished over an ongoing timeline. Students and volunteers will start in the program not at a predetermined time or interval but when a volunteer becomes available for each student on the waiting list. Both teachers and students transition out of the program when no longer able to continue or when goals have been met; if one of the pair must stop and the other wishes to continue, they will be rematched with a new partner. Volunteer recruitment, training and follow-up trainings are ongoing. Orientations are set up based on availability of each potential volunteer but are conducted quickly after initial conversations with staff. Volunteers report monthly to staff and discuss any needs, challenges or successes in addition to reporting hours taught and lesson plan progress.As students progress in their curriculum after starting classes, teachers complete evaluations for each lesson. Progress is tracked by staff, and additional assessments are done where needed and after the completion of a curriculum level. Lessons are designed to go at an average pace, but program allows for teachers and students to spend extra time on challenging concepts or supplement with targeted life skills materials for specific needs as they arise in the students' lives. Staff also conducts follow-up Life Skills and Student Perception Assessments every six months with each student to evaluate how students are able and willing to use their language skills in everyday life.","IRWP uses a variety of tools to assess student progress and impact which include:* Assessments from various book series are used to determine best resources for each student.  Laubach way to English, Ventures, Modern Curriculum Press Phonics, and Challenger are the core book series used.* Students' Perception Assessments -- During initial and follow-up assessments, students are evaluated on their comfort with interacting in English and level of personal stress, and ability to cope with doing daily living tasks independently.  * Student Life Skills Evaluations -- During initial and follow-up assessments, students are evaluated in a standard and scored format on their ability to use English and independently handle practical living skills.  * Curriculum Skills Evaluations -- Completed by volunteers after each section of lesson plans to show improvement of student's skills and challenges.  * Student Progress Reports -- Monthly progress in lessons/other milestones are tracked, allowing staff to see progress.* Student Demographics -- Tracks country of origin, gender, age, education level, ages of their children among other info, assessments dates and schedules.* Volunteer Demographics -- Tracks start and end dates, days of service, expected lengths of service, religious affiliations, length of service, how they found IRWP, and reasons for leaving.  * Teacher Training Data -- tracks orientations and one-on-one trainings and assessments.","IRWP office is still in the rental space we moved to in 2007. Our monthly rent is currently $800 per month and includes water and power. Many of our students are still in this vicinity. The office is near two main highways making it convenient for volunteers to come for trainings or to pick up resources. This space provides work areas for the Executive Director, Program Coordinator, Program Manager, three Program Assistants and a two day/week intern. The center area is large enough to conduct orientations and trainings for volunteers. We still have our open library space for additional reading materials for students and their children. Other space houses curriculum books, supplies, and in-kind items donated for the families of our students.

IRWP provides boombox CD players for curriculum and supplements that include audio components both during classes and between classes for self-study; volunteers will provide guidance on these to allow students to access interactive websites for practice at the appropriate levels. Many students are also able to afford and utilize computers, laptops and smart phones to listen to MP3s and use free websites or apps for extra independent practice. Volunteers also can employ the help of certain apps for teaching needs. We are mindful when encouraging students to use their phones that some might have data limits on their plans, so do not make the use of these technologies required or core to the curriculum.

","RAALP began operation in 2012, founded by residents of the EspaÃ±ola Valley dedicated to improving reading skills for adults, in an effort to break the cycles of low-literacy, poverty, and under- and unemployment in our communities. RAALP currently has 34 students actively matched with volunteer tutors.RAALP tutors are community volunteers certified through a full-day ProLiteracy training provided by the New Mexico Coalition for Literacy. RAALP has 4 free tutor trainings per year, 2 for Basic Literacy tutors & 2 for ESL tutors. After training, volunteers are matched and pairs make a commitment to meet for a minimum of two hours per week in a public location. Pairs are provided with materials from RAALP's literacy lending library: books, games, and digital learning resources are available. Some tutors also help their adult learner with basic math skills and/or computer literacy skills, on an asâ€needed basis and dependent on tutor comfort level. Onâ€going support includes ""continuing education"" sessions for tutors, tutoring technique webinars or other trainings, and annual tutorâ€student recognition/social event. Student progress, persistence, and satisfaction are monitored with annual standardized assessments such as CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System) as well as phone/email progress surveys from both tutors & students. Program staff meet face-to-face with the pair at least annually to review goals and study materials, and provide feedback/suggestions. ","The Rio Arriba Adult Literacy Program operates year-round. The office, located inside the Espanola Public Library at the Lucero Center, is open daily, Monday-Friday and two Saturday mornings per month. Funding is requested for Fiscal Year 2019-2020, which runs from July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020. Recruitment of volunteer tutors and of adult Basic Literacy and English-as-a-Second-Language students is on-going, year-round. Four full-day tutor training sessions take place during the year, with a BL tutor training and an ESL tutor training scheduled in the fall and again in the spring. Tutor-student pairs agree to meet weekly for at least two instructional hours, for a minimum of 6 months. Some pairs meet more frequently, or work on additional skills such as basic math or computer literacy, dependent on student and tutor interest/availability. Students are assessed with a standardized test at intake, and again after 40+ hours of instruction or at the end of the fiscal year. RAALP is currently transitioning from TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) assessment to CASAS. Student satisfaction, progress, and persistence are also monitored through an oral student satisfaction questionnaire; tutor surveys about student progress; and tutor report of progress benchmarks on monthly timesheets, which includes students' self-reported observations on the real-life impact of tutoring. 70% of active, 6-month+ students will improve skills/behavior/knowledge and/or belief in self.","In fiscal 2019-2020, RAALP will be phasing in CASAS assessments (currently winding down with TABE for reading and ESLOA for ESL oral comprehension); assessments are administered on student intake and student exit (where student is available), and are administered 1-2 times per year to each student to gauge progress. Student satisfaction, progress, and persistence are monitored through oral student satisfaction questionnaire and student self-report progress survey (1-2 times per year; includes questions about appropriateness/interest in study materials, goals/benchmarks achieved, other self-reported improvements), through a written/emailed tutor survey about student progress (1-2 times per year; includes ""soft"" measures of improvement such as student self-confidence, study habits, life skills, etc.). Tutors report student progress benchmarks on monthly tutor-hour timesheets submitted to RAALP program staff. Informal ""check-in"" with student-tutor pairs takes place as staff sees pairs at weekly tutoring sessions; at tutor in-service/continuing education and tutor exchange gatherings (several times per year); at special events and outreach events; and at the annual tutor-student appreciation social gathering. Staff observes/meets with student-tutor pair at least annually during a regularly-scheduled tutoring session; at this time, staff talks to pair about student goal progress and any goals revisions, and uses the opportunity to recommend additional study materials or methods. ","RAALP's office is located inside the EspaÃ±ola Public Library at the Lucero Center, a community facility that includes a public swimming pool, gym and fitness facility.

Additionally, the EspaÃ±ola Public Library has two banks of computers for use by the general public, which can be accessed by pairs during tutoring sessions or by students for between-tutor session use. Tutors use digital technology during direct instruction dependent on tutor comfort level and student goals; wherever possible, staff match students who express a desire to improve their computer literacy with computer-savvy tutors.RAALP is partnering with a local IT business to be able to offer refurbished laptops to students; this program is currently in the planning stage, but should be up and running for fiscal 2019-20.

Background checks will cost approximately $25 per individual, and we are requesting $1,000 towards this new programmatic cost. Consumable student materials need to be purchased every year; these are workbooks that students can write in and keep for future reference. RAALP is requesting $500 for additional digital educational materials for our student laptops. Money is requested to allow at least one staff member to attend the ProLiteracy conference in September.

After deciding on their academic goals and timeline, our students map out locally-relevant, labor market-driven career paths with greater employment and career growth opportunities. The Excel Center model is successful because it supports adults while they take advantage of a second chance that has been unavailable to them before now.What most separates The Goodwill Excel Center from other adult education models is that, in addition to the targeted job skills training, the educational program curriculum culminates in all students earning a state-recognized high school diploma. Students advance through The Goodwill Excel Center and meet all credit, testing, and graduation requirements students are required to meet in a traditional high school.The comprehensive supports offered by The Goodwill Excel Center makes this approach unique from other public schools. Our school is designed specifically to accommodate the distinctive challenges and circumstances of adult students. These services include free on-site childcare services and flexible class and counseling schedules. Classes are offered year-round, with course offerings in the morning, afternoon, and evening.","The Goodwill Excel Center is an ongoing program. Integration of these expanded services will begin with notification of funding. The Goodwill Excel Center structures its classes on five school terms each year, with student enrollment and development of individualized student career plans occurring during the month prior to the start of classes. The Summer 2019 term begins in June. Students come to the Excel Center with a huge range of skill level and credits needed to graduate, from students who left high school during the last half of their senior year and can graduate within a term or two, all the way to students who dropped out of the eighth grade and need remedial education before even starting to work towards their diploma.During enrollment, each student is assigned a life coach. Coaches work with students to identify potential barriers to their continued education, whether those barriers are short-term issues (such as food assistance, child care, or transportation) or long-term challenges (including family issues, student self-efficacy and self-confidence). The relationships that coaches create with each student are a critical factor in student success, providing security, confidence and encouragement for students to continue when the work becomes difficult and life barriers become difficult to manage. The Life Coach will also provide academic and career advising, as well as related case management services.","In our Goodwill Excel Centers, MERS Goodwill utilizes Edupoint's Synergy Student Information System to provide data and process management functionality. The software combines robust data analysis with extensive reporting and sharing options to analyze data, identify issues and trends, and ensures staff gets the information we need to solve problems and support student learning. We also use Synergy's Learning Management System software to facilitate classroom management, as well as centralize and organize curriculum, content and assessments. All of the data is entered into their respective systems on a timely basis. Participants are regularly assessed on their progress and feedback encouraged. Follow-ups will be performed at regular intervals during and after the completion of each goal. The rate of accomplishing these goals and objectives is dependent upon each individual and their unique circumstances.The Goodwill Excel Center curriculum meets all of the educational requirements established by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for high school graduation. During the enrollment process, we assess each student's High School Diploma course credit status, and track their progress towards meeting the state credit requirements for graduation.","Prior to the Goodwill Excel Center opening in October of 2018, two floors of our headquarters were renovated to provide suitable classroom space for our students.

Over time, Eva improved her reading and received her high school equivalency from the Dohn School! Eva said, ""I am glad I kept going and finally did it!"" Her future goal is to start real estate classes. She said she will ""keep on going!""","Hotline: Our staff is trained to answer incoming calls and to provide confidential counseling. Callers receive encouragement and information that prepares them to take the next step in their educational journey including the name, address and phone number of potential agencies that meet their needs. Calls on the hotline are tracked as they come in.Classes: Literacy Network offers classes free of charge for adults who read below 4th grade level. Classes utilize the Orton-Gillingham Multisensory approach, a structured language method supported by the International Dyslexia Association. Each candidate takes a brief screening to determine if this program is right for them. Classes are twice a week for two-hours a day. Students are tracked and progress monitored.Tutoring: We offer tutor trainings that serve as a foundation for individuals interested in becoming tutors. The Adult Coordinator tracks volunteers and every student in class is offered a tutor.Encourage Family Literacy: This effort focuses on reaching parents of the children we serve through attending Parent Information nights and providing books at PTA nights. The Literacy Network values the role family literacy plays in improving overall literacy rates. Little Free Libraries: Lending libraries are placed in neighborhoods throughout the city, with free books to encourage families to read both individually and together. These libraries also have our contact information on them if someone needs further services.","The Adult Literacy Services Program is an ongoing program. The Literacy Hotline is continuous and does not have a timeline attached to it. Approximately 1,500 to 2,300 calls are fielded annually.Training Sessions for the Tutor Training and Coordination Program are held the first Tuesday of every month (except for May, June, July and January), and tutors are placed following the training they attend. In addition to Tuesday training sessions, we have several volunteer tutor trainings at local high schools, colleges, businesses and organizations. Many of these volunteers are placed with elementary students, but there are always a few that volunteer with adult students.The timeline for the Adult Basic Reading Program is more specific and complicated, and details are provided below.Adult Basic Reading Program-Currently there are 2 classes running at the Literacy Network. Classes are held Monday through Thursday in the day time.-Currently there is a class running in Price Hill at Covedale Library in the evenings.-Currently there is a class running at the Pleasant Ridge Library in the daytime.  -Currently there is a class at Roll Hill (on break). ","Prior to beginning the Adult Basic Reading Program, potential students are screened using several standardized assessments, which also serve as their pre-program scores and helps determine if the class meets their educational needs. The measurable results are drawn from the following test:Word Attack scores (from the Woodcock Mastery Reading Test) give an assessment of a student's ability to correctly sound out letters and/or words to determine specific phonics elements the student may be struggling with. Statements from the IDA and the schools we work with agree with our Education Director that phonetics and word attack skills are one of the most important elements of testing to see if a person is learning to read. In addition, we have reached out to two Orton-Gillingham experts at Mount St. Joseph who agreed that word attack skills are one of the most telling measurements to test if this program is helping a student learn to read.At midpoint of each class (after 5 to 6 months of class), students are progress monitored to track their reading gains. At the end of each year (after 12 months), students are post-tested to assess their progress, and help determine the recommended next step to achieve their educational goal. Some students move on to the next session of ABRP classes, one-on-one tutoring, ABLE classes, GED preparation or apply for jobs. It is important to remember that each student has different goals, and our job is to help them achieve their goals.  ","We have the facilities, equipment and supplies necessary for the program, though we are always looking to expand and improve our program. Most recently, we have started reaching more adults through our Little Free Library efforts. Adults can receive free books for themselves and their children at the LFL in their neighborhood and our contact information is also on each library in case they need further services.The curriculum of our adult classes is based on the Orton-Gillingham Multisensory Approach, a research-based method proven to help students with learning disabilities. An in-room facilitator aids students as they respond to the DVD instruction and reviews the material with the students. Because the highly qualified DVD instructor delivers the lesson, the in-room facilitator does not need extensive training in the method. The Literacy Network offers them training and provides information to instructors. We also help new instructors get started and do follow-up visits to ensure success. A similar program costs $30-$60 per hour, which the demographic we serve cannot afford.The Literacy Network funds the TV, DVD player, bus tokens, key personnel and all supplies for class. We also pay a stipend for the instructor if needed, though most adult instructors are volunteers.Currently, five classes are held: Literacy Network (2 classes), Pleasant Ridge Library, Roll Hill and the Covedale Library. We are always open to beginning new classes in different areas of town.","The class utilizes a set of DVD's with dyslexia specialists on them, while a trained in-house instructor facilitates class learning. A television and DVD player are used for each class. We also received funding for iPads and applications to incorporate this technology in to the Adult Basic Reading classes and sometimes one-on-one tutor sessions.

Small classes and individual tutoring for contextualized learning will be offered on-site at partner organizations. The on-site location of services will aid in the communication of needs, and the referral process from project partners. Host sites additionally offer more access points for literacy services throughout the school district. As students move through the program their progress will be tracked by instructors and the RSU13 Academic Coordinator. Weekly staff meetings will inform any adjustments needed to curriculum, and services that would address barriers to education or employment (childcare, transportation, disabilities, cultural barriers, etc.). Referrals to resources, college or job site visits, and planning is incorporated in student advising meetings.","The project will begin on July 1, 2019 and will continue through June 30, 2020.  Students will be offered 6 weeks of summer programming with a minimum of 2 hours one-to-one tutoring and an additional 8 hours of drop-in Learning Center small group instruction per week. This ten-hour per week offering will help learners to continue with their studies during a time when services have not been offered in past years. Program referrals from partners and initial intake and advising appointments will begin in the summer for classes starting in September 2019.  Students will be offered 38 weeks of school year instruction with weekly schedules of: 2 hours one-to-one tutoring, 4 hours of small group class instruction.  In addition, students are invited to the drop-in Learning Centers to get guidance from instructors. The Drop-In Learning Center is open 24-30 hours weekly for 38 weeks during the school year.  ","CASAS, VARK, Northstar Digital Literacy, ACCUPLACER, and HiSET assessment pre-testing will occur during the student intake process. Post-tests will be administered at the end of class sessions, after 72 hours of instruction, or prior to the student leaving the program. Students will be post-tested using the assessment they were pre-tested with in order to find measurable gains.","RSU13 Adult Education's main office location houses a Learning Center and Computer Lab to service students across all programming.  As part of the school district these facilities, along with program supplies, are a stable and maintained feature of the program. In 2020, RSU13 Adult Education will reside in the greater downtown area of Rockland, within the multi-agency building that houses the Career Center, University of Maine Augusta at Rockland, and Department of Health and Human Services. Students in many cases can be referred ""just across the hall"" by case management staff and caseworkers. This co-location will help to establish a hub of services in a convenient and central locale with Adult Education fulfilling the imperative education component for all levels of literacy. The portable classrooms and satellite services will exist at a minimum of 3 partner locations, but potentially at several other sites, including employers, as the project matures. The initial portable classroom satellite sites will be at the Thomaston and Rockland Public Libraries, and at the Vocational Rehab Center in Rockland. The libraries offer access to target intergenerational illiteracy and strengthen awareness of community offerings.  ","The current 4 laptops used in our Adult & Community Education Learning Center were purchased 7 years ago.  They are insufficient for most standardized timed testing due to lack of speed and inability to sustain required updates on software necessary for testing.  There is a computer lab with 8 working desktop stations and a promethean device at the main office location of Adult Ed. This desktop lab is typically used for vocational or enrichment classes and offers a one-student-to-one-device ration. ALL RSU13 students are allowed to use these computers when the room is free of instruction. Students also have access to the 4 laptops in the Learning Center. RSU13 Adult Education receives free IT services from the school district, which includes but is not limited to the installation of new technology; software and hardware repair; on-site trouble-shooting; a  dedicated server with daily back-up of files; software installation; hardware upgrades, and the use of any district-owned technology such as smart boards, conferencing equipment and more.

Once matched with a tutor, learners are assessed with the English as a Second Language Oral Assessment (ESLOA), a standardized assessment which provides a brief measurement of the learners' ability to speak and understand English. Using results from the ESLOA, learners are placed into a textbook. Level One learners begin their study of English using the Laubach Way of English, Book One. Learners demonstrating proficiency above Level One begin in the ExpressWays series, Books One, Two or Three. As the textbook for our most beginning English-language learners, Laubach provides an introduction to the sounds and letters of the English language as well as the structure of beginning sentences and questions. The ExpressWays series offers learners the opportunity to learn conversations that are applicable to their everyday lives as well as English grammar. Based on the learners' initial placement in a textbook, they advance from Laubach One to ExpressWays One, Two and Three. Before a learner is able to move to the next level, they must successfully demonstrate that they have mastered the material by passing an end of book assessment. When a learner successfully completes ExpressWays Three, s/he graduates from Aquinas Literacy Center. Graduates are encouraged to register for advanced ESL classes, GED preparation or vocational training at the city colleges. ","Aquinas Literacy Center is open from September to June, from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday. On-site student registration is open throughout the year during these days and times.

Initially, this assessment is used to measure the learners' abilities and to appropriately place learners in the correct textbooks. After forty hours of instruction from a trained volunteer tutor, the learner is assessed using the ESLOA. At the time of the post-test, the learner, the tutor and the staff of Aquinas Literacy Center are able to see if the learner has demonstrated gains in English. If the learner does not demonstrate measurable gains at the time of the post-test, then the learner, the tutor and the staff (either the Executive Director or the Program Director) will discuss why gains have not been made and will develop a plan so that the learner will demonstrate progress at the next testing interval.

SVSF Center provides free individualized tutoring sessions and students may attend unlimited amount of sessions each week at six different campuses throughout the city of Detroit. Adult students attend an Orientation Session, learning about GED/HSE testing and how the program works. Students then formally enroll in the Adult Education and Workforce Development Programs, completing an assessment-TABE test to gauge the student's educational level that is used to create an individualized learning plan for each student. SVSF Center utilizes the 2018 Kaplan GED Test Primer and/or the 2018 HiSET Exam Primer. After completing chapters and practice testing, students move on the official GED or HiSET test. Kahn Academy and Essential Education on-line tools are also utilized to help accelerate students learning. In order to increase the number of graduates, SVSF Center will have blended sessions that include attendance at campus sessions as well as on-line supplemental sessions off campus. The Kaplan and HiSet curriculums consist of essential concepts for Reasoning through Language Arts, Mathematical Reasoning, Science and Social Studies. SVSF Center provides not only literacy and numeracy core concepts, the Program also supports computer literacy and Workforce Development activities. ","SVSF Center's Adult Education provides students an open-ended timeline for adult students to prepare and pass the GED/HSE testing. Students enter the program at varying levels and they are able to work at their own pace. Students enrolled in the program range from 18 to 60 years of age and those students testing at a sixth grade level will require a longer duration than those adults that test at higher levels. Each student's assessment score, the average time for an adult student in the program is 12 to 18 months. The timeline is dependent upon each adult student's work plan and the amount of time devoted to their studies. There are many variables that factor into their attainment of their stated goals. SVSF approaches its educational model from a social work perspective and has identified that students often need assistance with overcoming the barriers to education that prevented them from obtaining their diploma.  The program aims to motivate and support the students and help them to break through these barriers. Adult student scoring at the 6th grade level are considered ""Pre-GED/HSE"" and then assigned work sheets and individualized tutoring begins to aid the student in obtaining the needed skills to transition to the next level, the GED lessons book. Adult students that score at the 12th grade level are placed in the GED Preparation level. Over 6,000 units of services (1.5 hour sessions) will be provided through free day and evening sessions.","SVSF Center utilizes TABE as the assessment tool used to determine the student's skill levels and aptitudes. The purpose of the test is to measure how much education the student has already mastered. The TABE assesses the student's basic skills as reading, writing, and math, the foundational skills that all education builds on. This is the baseline for the student's progress. The Kaplan and HiSet curriculums consist of essential concepts for Reasoning through Language Arts, Mathematical Reasoning, Science and Social Studies. Each chapter's tests measures knowledge and skills in the areas of English language arts (""Reasoning through Language Arts"" module, which measures skills in reading and writing), mathematics (the ""Mathematical Reasoning"" module), social studies, and science. Each of the content modules is an independent test that may be taken individually, at any time and in any order, based on the convenience to and preparedness of the test-taker. Staff and Tutors provide individualized instruction and mentoring for each adult student assisting them in mastering the concepts. As each chapter has been mastered by the students, the gain is noted in the SVSF Center database. Official Practice tests through the GED/HiSet is offered free of charge and when the student passes each practice test they are now ready to take the Official Test. SVSF Center provides transportation to and from the test and also pays for the test.","All SVSF Center Campus facilities are equipped with the necessary supplies, computers, calculators, and Kaplan and HiSet Book Primers that are needed for students' educational needs. As student's progress through their Kaplan and HiSet books curriculums; any necessary equipment or other materials instructors deem important to each students' learning. ",All adult students have access to computers and computer labs at all six campus locations. The student to technology ratio is 1 to 8. Computers are equipped with Windows 7 Professional and IT and tech support is provided to maintain and update computers and software. Students also access these computers in order to take Official Practice test that are paid for by the Center.,Yes,"SVSF Center proposes to incorporate two on--line learning tools; Kahn Academy and Essential Education. Students can augment their in-session education by having additional time outside their sessions through on-line learning tools. Integrated supplemental on-line study with hand held devices and smart phones enables students to increase supported study time when not in their classroom session. SVSF will utilize Kahn Academy's website of simple instruction videos to enhance student's study at home. The addition of Essential Education's High School Equivalency Academies will assist the Adult Education Staff in monitoring student's at-home progress and give tutors help on where a student needs more attention in their classroom setting. Online study will also help students acquire digital literacy and readiness, as well as online learning skills. One aspect, often overlooked in adult education programs, is the skills set needed to learn online. These skills can all be acquired in a blended learning environment. Competency, comfort, and proficiency with online learning can be a great benefit of a blended learning model for adult education students. SVSF provides these skills in our computer lab and with smart phone assistance.","$643,500.00 ","$12,000.00 ","SVSF Center is requesting $12,000 from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation.

","BCTC Skills U is helping to transform our community by improving the educational levels of many undereducated adults living in our communities by assisting them with obtaining critical credentials such as the GED, the National Career Readiness Certificate, improving their English language, transitioning into postsecondary education, and creating a more skilled workforce.Today, there are nearly 26,457residents age 18 -- 65 without a high school credential in Anderson, Clark, Fayette, and Scott counties. BCTC recognizes that in order for our communities to be successful, we must provide opportunities for these individuals to obtain a high school credential that prepares them for college and career. Since 2010, BCTC has assisted 2,263 residents attain their GED. We are proud of our success rate but understand that more work needs to be done.In working with this population, we have realized that several barriers can sometimes prevent individuals from obtaining their GED. Our students are often the neediest in our communities and lack the financial resources needed to pay the $120 testing fee (30 x 4 subsections=$120). The BCTC Skills U (Adult Education) program is seeking funds to cover the costs of one or all four of the test subsets to allow students to take the exam regardless of their ability to pay. ","BCTC Skills U plays an integral role in creating a more skilled workforce by offering the following educational opportunities: GED credential, the National Career Readiness Certificate (NCRC), the Kentucky Employability Skills Certificate (KESC), English language instruction, and assistance with transitioning to postsecondary education. We work diligently to develop new curriculum that utilizes national standards, the latest adult education pedagogies, and research. Our curricular approach is relevant, interactive, digitally infused, and contextualized for a real-world approach using KYAE Skills U employability standards. While BCTC Skills U strives to help adult learners achieve their learning goals, oftentimes paying for GED testing is a barrier to student success. Our students are often the neediest in our communities and cannot afford the $120 GED testing fee. Currently, KYAE Skills U support prohibits utilizing funds to pay for these items; therefore, we must seek additional financial support to assist our students. Financial support from this grant can help remove this barrier from our most financially vulnerable adult learners. Adult Learners eligible for the Dollar General GED Exam Fund must demonstrate financial need, diligently complete course work, and pass sections of the GED Ready test with a score of 145 or higher. Funds from this grant in the ford of GED test vouchers will be provided to BCTC Skills U students once they meet these eligibility requirements. ","BCTC Skills U strives to ensure that adult learners earn their GED as quickly as possible and, therefore, provides both day and evening classes, as well as online offerings. Skills U Instructors diligently identify GED FastTrack students whose TABE and/or GED Ready assessments indicate that they are very close to passing the GED exam. GED FastTrack students attend a total of at least 12 hours of instruction and complete all program requirements within one month of enrollment. GED students who need a more intense program of study are expected to attend at least 2 days per week for a total of 4 hours per week until 40 hours of instruction are attained. After students attain 40 hours of instruction, they are given a new assessment to determine whether they are ready or not to pass the GED exam. Instructional timelines vary for each individual student; however, the program goal is that students complete their GED as quickly as possible so that they may then transition to obtaining gainful employment, other training programs, and/or postsecondary education.   ","BCTC Skills U will utilize the TABE Locator and TABE Complete Battery for the initial assessment. Once the assessment is complete, the student and the instructor will develop a learning plan to meet individual educational goals. The participant will demonstrate learning gains sufficient to allow attainment of the GED goal or post-testing for level gains. Instructors will continuously monitor each participant's progress. If a participant is not demonstrating progress, the instruction will be re-evaluated to determine if the best possible learning strategy is being utilized. As the participant makes progress, a new assessment will be administered in accordance with Kentucky Adult Education Skills U policy and guidelines. Testing will determine if academic progress is being achieved. The GED Ready test will be used once the TABE Complete Battery indicates that the student is on target to successfully pass it.  ","All facilities are professional institutions designed for student success. The facilities meet ADA compliance requirements and are provided by BCTC and other partners. Each space allows for structured programming and is housed throughout the Bluegrass Region with easy access to public transportation where available. Free parking is also provided at all locations.

Community Classrooms are focused on helping adult students who readbelow the sixth-grade level, or who are struggling to learn the English Language, improve theirliteracy and English skills. Skill improvement is measured by test results using the TABE (TestAssessing Basic Education) and TABE CLAS-E (Complete Language Assessment System -English).By improving their skills, Indy Reads is creating a foundation for students to meet theirGoals, and to be able to join the workforce, obtain a better job, move on to High School Equivalency classes or an Adult High School, or learn a trade. Additionally, our new certifications program will provide new, career-focused support for students who want to apply new literacy skills to specific career tracks in customer service roles.We anticipate:a.

Instructors are supported by trained volunteers who know and understand the educational principles behind working with adult literacy and ELL students. Volunteers attend an Indy Reads training and receive ongoing support from program staff. Volunteers are matched with students either one-on-one or in small groups, as student needs dictate. Instructors create individualized lesson plans based on students' current literacy levels as well as the students' unique goals. Students are grouped together by skill level and volunteers provide individualized guidance -- hands-on attention that would be otherwise impossible in a classroom setting.This classroom structure allows Indy Reads to provide consistent, high quality literacy and English language instruction to our students. Instructors monitor the quality of the volunteers' teaching and are able to support and mentor as needed. The tailored, individualized lesson plans give instructors the resources to ensure no student falls behind.Once students have received at least 50 hours of instruction, their literacy or English levels are again assessed using the TABE or TABE CLAS-E assessment. These assessments provide valuable feedback that allows the instructors to focus on each students' most needed area of literacy.","The timeline for this project follows our academic year which will begin by August 12, 2019, and run through May 21, 2020. Classes meet two or three times per week, depending on the class, for a total of six hours of in-person instruction each week per student. ","To align with and benchmark against other adult education providers in the state of Indiana, Indy Reads uses TABE tests to assess the educational gains of adult literacy students. To measure educational gains with ELL students, Indy Reads uses the TABE CLAS-E. Students have their levels assessed after approximately 50 hours of classroom instruction, as is standard with students reading below a sixth-grade level.Attendance and classroom hours are tracked by Indy Reads' administrative staff, who then alert a member of the programs team when students have completed sufficient hours to receive a test. The testing is performed by an Instructional Aide and testing results are compiled by the administrative team -- all independently of the teaching staff. Indy Reads utilizes the Indiana Technical Education Reporting System (or InTERS), a database offered by the state of Indiana, to track and report student progress.","The Community Classrooms program prefers clean, well-lit classroom or meeting room with locked storage for materials. We have a strong preference for spaces with computer labs for student use, that are located near bus stops, and that are in underserved and economically disadvantaged communities in Marion County.","All our current classroom locations have a computer lab that is accessible for our students, and Indy Reads has a supply of laptop computers students and teachers can check out to bolster their digital literacy.

This is lower than the 3.8% unemployment rate in Grand Rapids, the largest city in the county. While there is low unemployment, we recognize that the hardest-hit residents in Kent County are still those with less than a high school education (7.2% unemployment in 2017) and people of color (13.4% unemployment in 2017 among Black/African Americans and 8.4% among Hispanic/Latinos). ","According to 2017 data of a 4 year cohort, the graduation rate in the Kent County ISD is 79.4%, an increase from 79% in 2016. That drops to 62.1% among black students and 72.2% among Hispanic/Latino students. In Grand Rapids Public Schools, the graduation rate stands at 66.6%. Nearby urban school districts fare only slightly better; Godfrey Lee, Godwin Heights, and Wyoming Public Schools all have a graduation rate between 70% and 80%.  ","The American Community Survey (2017) indicates that 13.4% of the Kent County population lives in poverty, including 28.2% of African American residents and 29.2% of Latino residents.

However, we recognize this is outdated information. We know that this number has not only increased in the last 16 years, it is significantly higher in the communities we serve. Our intention, contingent on funding, is to commission a study in Grand Rapids to determine the adult literacy rate on a local level.",,The Adult Tutoring Program will instruct 280 adult learners through one-on-one tutoring in the 2019-20 program year. The instruction is delivered by volunteer tutors who work alongside a learner for 2 hours a week for at least six months. Tutors utilize workbooks and real life materials that are contextualized to the immediate needs and goals of the learner. We expect learners will make literacy gains and accomplish personal goals because the instruction is immediately relevant and applicable. ,"The Adult Tutoring Program anticipates instructing 280 learners in the 2019-20 program year, approximately 40 ABE and 240 ESL learners. The program's key objectives, with corresponding outcomes, are outlined in ATP's program logic model (available upon request). Objective 1: Improve the literacy skills of participating adults. We support tutors in providing quality, contextualized instruction to our learners. As a result, we anticipate 85% of learners (238) will have a score gain on a CASAS test.  Objective 2: Support learners achieving an identified goal. Tutoring can be contextualized to potential goals such as getting citizenship or a driver's license, obtaining or retaining a job, speaking in English in the community, or communicating in English with their children's teachers. We anticipate 95% of learners (266) will report accomplishing a goal or learning a new life skill.  Objective 3: Recruit and retain learners and tutors. To reach 280 learners instructed, we need to continually recruit tutors to provide instruction to ATP learners. In addition, we need to retain learners so that they are reaching the 40 hour threshold for a CASAS test, and are following through on taking the test. Due to the structure of the program and the fluidity of our learners' lives, getting post-tests from each learner can be a challenge. We anticipate 60% of our instructed learners (168 adults) will take a post-test after 40 hours of instruction. ","ATP is designed to provide adult learners with individualized literacy instruction in the content areas that are most relevant to their goals, including job attainment and training, supporting their children, and navigating systems such as banking and healthcare. Staff members work with learners to identify their personal literacy goals and then devise a plan to help the learner achieve those goals.To help learners improve their literacy skills, the program's curriculum uses standard adult literacy materials (Stand Out, Challenger, Ventures, The Active Reader) that are heavily supplemented with materials from learners' own lives.Learners meet with a volunteer tutor in a public location for 2 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months. There is flexibility with timing and location, which helps to reduce barriers such as transportation and childcare. This one-on-one tutoring model also offers a more comfortable environment for ABE learners.Adult learners bring with them a great deal of life experience that they can access as they learn a new language and new skills. Literacy Center tutors use a variety of strategies to adapt to the diverse learning styles of the Literacy Center learners. Tutors provide reading, writing, and listening instruction using tasks or authentic materials that are relevant to learners' everyday lives. As a result, learners are seeing the immediate results of their instruction and are more likely to remain committed to the program.","ATP's program year runs from July 1- June 30, although it is an open-entry, open-exit program. Interested tutors attend a volunteer orientation and then 12 hours of tutor training (offered monthly). ESL learners who are interested in the program must first attend an orientation that is offered at the Literacy Center 3 times per month at two different times of day. Following orientation, ESL learners attend an intake with a literacy coordinator, where they discuss the learner's literacy goals and receive a more thorough description of the program. We have eliminated the orientation step for ABE learners to facilitate faster enrollment and remove a potentially uncomfortable step in the process. After the intake, learners are matched with a volunteer tutor.Because the tutoring program is highly individualized, learners work with their tutor to set up a schedule that works for the pair. Learners and tutors meet 2 hours a week for a total of 8 hours of instruction each month. Learners also commit to doing at least 30 minutes of daily homework. Pairs commit to a minimum of 6 months.Group testing takes place 4 times a year for ATP learners who have reached 40+ hours of instruction since their last test. The testing is offered at the Literacy Center at various days and times to accommodate learners' varying schedules.Learners can stay in the program until they meet their goals as long as they meet regularly, do homework, take post-tests, and continue to make progress.","The Literacy Center uses two CASAS tests for learner assessment and to determine eligibility: the Life and Work series for all ESL learners, and the Reading GOALS series for all ABE learners. The Literacy Center accepts learners with pre-test scores ranging between 153 and 235 on forms 27/28 through 187/188D in the L&W series, and between 200 and 237 on forms 901/902 through 905/906 in the Reading GOALS series. ESL learners take a reading assessment at orientation and a listening assessment at intake; ABE learners take only a reading assessment during intake.ATP learners also have a one-on-one intake with a Literacy Coordinator. During that time, learners identify goals and complete a participant goal sheet developed in consultation with our external evaluator.Learners are post-tested after every 40 hours of instruction. Group testing is offered at the Literacy Center quarterly, and staff members follow up with learners who are not able to make the group session.ATP also utilizes tutoring logs to track learner improvement and goal attainment. The logs are submitted monthly by the tutor, and include the instructional hours plus lesson content, and notes on the learner's progress.All learner demographic and testing information is entered into an internal database, LACES, and the state database upon registration of a new learner, testing and reception of monthly logs. The ATP Director pulls reports from both databases monthly to ensure accuracy and completeness.","The Literacy Center of West Michigan is located at 1120 Monroe Avenue NW, about a mile north of downtown Grand Rapids. The building is along a bus route and has ample free parking, making it easily accessible for learners and tutors. The building houses the Literacy Center's office and also space for training rooms and tutoring rooms for tutor/learner pairs. The training rooms, used for all tutor training sessions, include a smart board, projection unit, and television screens for optimal instruction. The Literacy Center has an on-site library containing a wide variety of materials that are both level and age appropriate for adult learners. The texts include newspapers, supplementary graded reading, textbooks for both ABE and ESL learners, citizenship materials, and reference materials for tutors. Tutors and learners also have access to tools such as letter tiles, phonemic awareness flashcards, and educational games to assist learners at various levels. The library has tables and chairs for learners and tutors to use for tutoring or for individual study.That said, the tutoring program is successful for learners because it provides flexibility with locations. Learners are able to meet at a convenient place and at a time that works within their own schedule. This can include a location on a bus line, a public library, or someplace near their home. We believe that this is an important programmatic element to reducing learners' barriers to attendance.  ","The Literacy Center recognizes the importance of technology for delivering literacy services, and also the learners' increasing interest in developing their own computer literacy skills. Because much of the tutoring takes place at locations outside of the Literacy Center, the staff devotes time during tutor training to share electronic resources that tutors can use for professional development and in their tutoring sessions. There is free Wi-Fi available at the Literacy Center for any tutors or learners who bring in their own devices for the tutoring sessions. Tutoring pairs who meet at public libraries have free access to Wi-Fi, plus the computers and tablets at those libraries. Additionally, we have six portable CD players that any tutoring pair may use during lessons, or which may be used by learners at home to do homework and practice. These CD players are mainly used for practice with audio books and audio CDs, which come as complements to textbooks and may be used by tutoring pairs during lesson or as homework.Finally, we offer our tutors web-based access to 'News for You', by New Readers' Press, which gives access to graded news to use in the lesson, and to 'The Change Agent', a digital magazine that offers graded texts and activities about cultural issues around the world.

Participants will receive intensive, accelerated instruction in language arts and math and avoid college developmental classes. The expected project outcomes include: 1) a reliable program that prepares Adult Education students for immediate transition to college and 2) participants will score 165+ on each GED subject and be prepared for college placement.  ","According to an Annual Statistical Report from Kaskaskia College's Institutional Research office, two-thirds of all GED test-takers indicated they planned to further their education by enrolling in a technical, two-year or four-year college program. Sadly, only one-half actually enrolled in a postsecondary program and only 4% earned a degree. After completing their GED program, many students are still not prepared for standard college classes and often exhaust their funding taking remedial courses. The Kaskaskia College First Step College Bound (FSCB) initiative is a pilot program that identifies low-income individuals who are first generation college students that do not have a high school diploma or High School Equivalency Credential. FSCB provides intense accelerated instruction, ongoing feedback, and social service resource referrals to assist students in successfully transitioning from the adult education classroom into the higher education environment. Thus, students avoid being placed in developmental language arts or math courses and have all other social barriers removed that may hinder their college admittance.The goal of the FSCB pilot project is to develop a reliable program that prepares Adult Education students for immediate transition to postsecondary education or training. The objective is for participants to score 165 or higher on each GED subject and be prepared for immediate college placement. ","The First Step College Bound (FSCB) pilot program will begin with a cohort of fifteen students that meet the required criteria: first generation college student; a minimum score of 576 on TABE 11 and 12; and a NRS Level above four. These students must have pre-initiated a goal of college admittance. The Education Coordinators, Education Director and instructors will work together to develop curricular and instructional program models that integrate foundational skills in literacy and numeracy, and help prepare the student for the academic demands of postsecondary education study. Upon orientation, the student will be give the TABE to see if they qualify for the FSCB program.The coordination team will map out a blueprint of instruction of skills needed to advance for each participant. After forty hours of instruction the student will be retested with the TABE. If the results indicate improvement, the student will be given the GED practice test. If the student scores below a 165, the student will continue to work on the skills needed. If the student scores above a 165, then the student will take the full GED section. Once the student passes each section of the GED with a 165 or above, they will transition into admission into a postsecondary education institution. Throughout the entire program, the Education Coordinator will monitor attendance, effort and progression and make referrals to partner agencies to eliminate any barrier that might hinder success. ","The project outcomes will be achieved by providing activities as follows over an anticipated twelve-month period:1)	Program entry -- orientation, pretest and placement2)	Classroom instruction -- two, three-hour sessions per week. One hour per month meeting one-on-one with instructor to assess progress and individual instruction. Monthly meeting with Education Coordinator to chart progress and make social service referrals if necessary3)	Retest after 40 classroom hours or 15 class sessions of instruction.4)	Expectation of completion is nine to twelve months after entry. Since instruction is self-paced, range may vary.5)	Final evaluation of project to determine applicability for replication followed by dissemination of results. ","Each student will begin with a Career assessment worksheet to determine their desire to continue to post-secondary education.  The student will be given the TABE 11 & 12 as a pretest starting point. The results of the TABE pretest will determine the skills needed to reach the desired goal and give a TABE skills blueprint. This blueprint will provide the guidelines for the skills needed to reach the end goal and drive the curriculum. The GED pretest will give participants an indication of where they currently stand. Once they reach the goal score on the pretest, each student will take the GED.  The college entrance placement test ACCUPLACER can also be used to help evaluate the student. It is a national test for college placement levels.  The GPA of the first semester of college will be a measure of how prepared the participants are for the first semester of post-secondary education. They will also be tracked to determine ultimate goal attainment. Kaskaskia College's Assessment Coordinator and the Office of Institutional Research will provide support for assessment activities.

We have a computer lab with 30 computers; however, one class is held in the computer lab.  Therefore, the other four  classes share 20 laptops among their students.  With additional laptops, the students will experience hands-on learning that is engaging and mentally stimulating.  We have observed that the inclusion of the computers in the classroom increases retention.   Our goal is to equip our students with the necessary tools to be successful in the future.  Using the computer more regularly will allow them to have a better advantage in being able to compete with others educationally and in the workforce.

Within the 6-7 weeks, the students are able to obtain the 40 hours necessary to post-test.  Enrollment - Since there isn't a large number of ESL and literacy students, they are allowed to enter as they arrive.  For all other students, enrollment is held two weeks prior to the beginning of each term of classes.  Afterwards, enrollment is held every Friday (late start classes).  Students are initially placed in our state mandated Smart Start Program.  This is a computer-based class that teaches students basic skills, career awareness and necessary skills for employment.  After students finish this class, they are placed in a high school equivalency prep class based upon their skill levels.   Once the students have received  40 hours of instruction, they are post-tested and hopefully moved to the next level.  The literacy students are moved to the next level as well, and the ESL students are moved to the next level in their curriculum or to HSE prep classes if desired.

Two important factors to consider when reviewing the unemployment rate is the large segment of the population that speaks English less than ""very well,"" estimated at 32% (ACS, 2017), and the number of adults over 25 years of age who have completed less than a 9th grade education, estimated at 16%.","The dropout rate for our community is high at 12% according to the 2018 New York State Education Department data. For English Language Learners, who make up 32% of the student population, the dropout rate is 38%. English language acquisition is a factor in the high dropout rate. Also, about 9 out of 10 students are economically disadvantaged according to state data. Parents who also have limited English language skills impact the progress of their children's education.","The poverty rate for our community is 11.2 % (ACS, 2017). Factors contributing to the poverty rate are limited English language skills and low education attainment.  Census data shows that 40% of the population is foreign born and adults over age 25 represent the largest group of this category.  Limited English language skills compounded with difficulty in navigating the job search which today requires computer access and knowledge, can amount to low paying jobs and unemployment.  ","Our service population is in Suffolk county.  The county organization, Literacy Suffolk, Inc.  has geared its basic literacy program to adults who read and write below a 6th grade level.  Using this measure about 10% of our adult population aged 25 and older have received less than 6 grades of education (2017 American Community Survey). In our community 1 out of 8 adults, over age 25, is not meeting the level for functioning literate adults in society.",,"In December, 2018 we created a Learning Center to provide literacy training to adults in an asynchronous environment. We will expand our current program to add 110 students for a total of 220 students. We will increase tutor recruitment efforts with educational institutions and will change the tutoring model to include small group tutoring. This expansion will serve a need in our community for flexible adult learning.","Our organization opened the Learning Center in December, 2018 with the goal to provide literacy services for the growing number of students who require asynchronous learning because they cannot attend a regularly scheduled class. The poverty rate for the community we serve is 11.2% (ACS, 2017) and about 32 % of the population speaks English less than ""very well, "" (ACS, 2017). An estimated 16% of adults over the age 25 have received less than a 9th grade education. These facts support the need for a Learning Center that can help adults improve their literacy skills, attain better job opportunities, improve their quality of life and increase their community engagement.The objective for phase two of the Learning Center is to increase our student enrollment from the initial 110 students to 220 students.  We completed the first stage that included building the physical space, training tutors, developing processes from intake to placement and learning plans.  Our organization has collaborated with a local university to provide additional tutors and with increased tutor recruitment and a model progression from one to one tutoring to small group tutoring, we can undertake an expansion of the Learning Center's student population. In addition, our partner for literacy training, Literacy Suffolk, has provided training for library staff to train literacy tutors and that will ensure we expedite tutor to student assignments.","The Brentwood Public Library is a community hub where adults come for many of their needs.  In a community with high unemployment and poverty rates and low literacy among adults, we responded with needed services. In December 2018 we opened the Learning Center, an adult literacy program that offers flexible training to adults who are unable to attend day or night classes because of family or work schedule restraints. We prepared a physical space with study rooms and study areas, recruited and trained tutor volunteers, purchased texts and language testing software and assigned tutors to work with students using personalized learning plans and flexible schedules to improve the students' literacy skills. In phase one of the Learning Center we have undertaken the placement of 110 students in our literacy program. The program objective for phase two of the Learning Center is to expand our services to add another 110 students for a total of 220 program participants. Our teaching model will be expanded to include small group tutoring and one to one tutoring. Tutor training has improved because we now have on staff a tutor trainer who has been trained by our literacy partner, Literacy Suffolk, a local not for profit organization. This will expedite preparation of tutors and assignment to students. In addition, we have improved our tutor recruitment by partnering with a local university that will direct graduate students to our program to satisfy their curriculum requirements","Students in the Learning Center agree to devote 6 hours of study per week. Tutors create a personalized learning plan for each student and students and tutors work with a flexible time schedule. After 30 hours of study, a student is evaluated to determine if there are literacy and language gains. With the funding we are requesting, the Learning Center can move to phase two of our center and increase student population from 110 to 220, purchase additional texts and technology. We have already in place the physical location of the Learning Center, a system of training tutors in house, and student applications. With grant funding we will expand the use of technology by students and provide tutors with additional educational aids such as software and texts. Phase two will begin September, 2019 and will continue through February, 2020. With this time period, we will have substantial evaluation results to review on students' literacy gains.","Overall student improvement will be measured by comparing the Best PLUS or Best Literacy test score from the start of the program to the score achieved after completion of the program period. In administering the Best PLUS oral evaluation, examiners will score the student based on their level of language complexity, comprehension and communication in English.  For students with higher English proficiency, the Best Literacy exam will be administered to determine the student's ability to read and write in English. Each period of 30 hours of study completed by the student, will require a new test to determine if progress is being made or if the student's individualized learning plan requires modification. ","The Brentwood Public Library is strongly committed to improving adult literacy in our community and the Dollar General Literacy grant assisted us in making our first steps to addressing this issue. In the first phase of the Learning Center in 2018, we were able to convert unneeded shelf space into a learning area with study rooms and quiet space. Educational aids such as texts, whiteboards and i-Pads were purchased to supply students with learning tools. In December, 2018 we opened the Learning Center and students and tutors have been working together, following personalized learning plans and investing in the study that can change lives.The library opened the Learning Center with the vision it would be a multi-phase project. With the physical space ready, staff and tutors trained, processes streamlined, and students evaluated for placement, we believe we are ready to undertake phase two and move ahead in enrolling more students and expanding with additional technology and educational aids for students. ",In 2018 we purchased ten i-Pad mini tablets for the Learning Center. These are adequate for individual tutoring but do not work well when tutoring small groups. Some of the group activities require a large screen so that all can benefit from small group lessons.,Yes,"The Brentwood Public Library proposes to equip the Learning Center with 10 laptop computers and an interactive whiteboard. Laptop computers can be effectively used with individual students to complete reading, writing, and speaking assignments as they work with a tutor and independently. Literacy and language learning software will be uploaded to each laptop. For small group sessions with students, an interactive whiteboard can be very powerful in presenting group lessons and demonstrations. The Learning Center offers language workshops by language proficiency levels.  An interactive whiteboard will be a dynamic tool that can spark collaboration between students and participation in group discussions.","$15,000.00 ","$30,000.00 ","As the Learning Center moves to phase two, we will expand our enrollment to more students and add small group tutoring to our tutoring model. The Learning Center will need additional technology and learning aids to accommodate a larger student population.Instructional material costs are for the purchase of texts, DVDs and CDs to be used by tutors instructing students.Software costs are for online learning programs for students' use on laptops.Best PLUS tests are used to place students in correct literacy level and are administered at regular intervals to measure literacy gains and to identify modifications to learning plans.Computer costs represent the purchase of 10 laptops to be used for individual student study with tutor. Laptops will be loaded with language and literacy software. We are also requesting funds to purchase an interactive whiteboard to be used in group meetings such as language workshops and reading groups.

Lesson topics focus on present culture, and everyday life in their familiar immediate communities including work, school, family and leisure. As students progress through each level of the the program, they will create and build upon a solid foundation which will motivate them as they find their own success with learning English. Our program is unique because we connect our ESL work with the financial counseling and economic integration programming also offered at Casa Azafran, for a holistic experience to integrate English into daily life.  ","Our stated outcomes will take place between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. ESL classes take place during the mornings and evenings at Casa Azafran, located at the gateway to Nashville's international district on Nolensville Road. Classes are 120 minutes in length and meet twice per week for a period of 3 months. We offer summer, fall and spring sessions of the classes. Each student receives approximately 50 instructional hours per semester. Our program ranges from beginner to intermediate levels.","We currently offer 6 different levels of ESL, and conduct testing to place students in the correct level. Students take an Oxford University online placement test as part of the registration process. The majority of our students enter the program needing to improve their grammar and or speaking skills. The majority of our students need a foundation to build on to gain a more usable level of English within their community.Students complete quizzes and exams that assess their level of pragmatic understanding of English. Quizzes take place after each chapter to assess material comprehension. The progress exam occurs in the middle of the term and the final exam occurs at the end of the term. We track this data using our organization's Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) performance management software system. We end each semester with a celebration and ceremony, and give certificates of participation or graduation to the students who have completed the course.","Conexion Americas has provided literacy services since our inception in 2002, and since 2012, have managed the collaborative work that takes place among 9 different immigrant and refugee-serving nonprofit agencies at Casa Azafran. Our ESL program is open to all immigrant and refugee adults, and this semester is serving students who are native Spanish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Portuguese speakers.We have five classroom spaces in our building that are fully equipped with projectors, screens, whiteboards and other equipment necessary for classes.","We have laptop computers, flat-screen TVs, and projectors available for use when requested/needed by instructors.

Of those, 19% of the workforce population have no High School Equivalency. ",,"We will serve 1100 people in Adult Basic Education and Adult Secondary Education instruction.  Eight hundred of those will be working toward their GED credential, and we intend to move 200 of those to  GED completion by improving access to official GED testing services and improving financial access to official GED test modules. The Elevating Tri County  Project will be used to fully or partially subsidize up to 480 exams.","The objective of our request is to provide expanded opportunities and subsidized testing for the Official GED testing for our learners.  The assistance we request will remove the financial barrier they face once obtaining qualifying scores.  We know this makes a difference.  Last year, we subsidized official GED tests the first half of the 2018-19  year with 50 GED completions and 38 learners attained partial GED credential completions.  In January, we reduced the subsidy to one half of the test fee, and we have had only 1 GED completion (to date) and 11 partial GED completions.  Our number of examinees dropped from an average of 8 per week to   2 per week.  Simply put, the testing fees make a difference in our students' ability to finish the GED credential.  This $30,000 undertaking will utilize the Pearson VUE mobile test site which will improve testing frequency and access for our learners.  This project will also improve financial access to to more test modules which will fully subsidize nearly 500 Official GED modules for the Tri County Area.  Last year, Laurel subsidized testing and met 100% of their state GED goal.  Knox and Whitley had no funding dollars to subsidize official GED test modules, and met 18% (Knox) and 46% (Whitley) of their GED goals. ","Through this project, we will expand testing sites  and subsidize test fees.  This will remove the barriers of inadequate cash to test and the problem of the proximity to a testing site. The Kentucky Office of Adult Education identifies a high need county by the largest number of working age adults without a High School Diploma or a GED.  There are 25 out of 120 counties in Kentucky considered high need, and all three of our counties are included. GED acquisition for the Tri Counties has significant economic impact by directly correlating to the local Workforce Investment Board's Strategic Plan of more post-secondary skilled certifications.  In order to achieve post-secondary certification, the individual must first earn a High School Equivalency (HSE).   The project design is straightforward; to qualify for the subsidized testing fees (dubbed 4 for 4), the learner must participate in test preparation tutorials in GED test navigation, do preview questions published by GED Testing Service, watch prescribed videos designed to increase  scores, and set and keep goal dates to complete each testing module.  This design will keep the learners moving forward in order to keep their test subsidy.   We provide ample learning center hours from 9 am - 8 pm Monday through Thursday and the other 4 full time centers are open until 7 pm at least two nights per week. We have several weekend events throughout the year and coordinate Sunday afternoon testing with a local Pearson VUE test site.","Weeks 1:  Design 4 for 4 promotional materials.Week 2:  Train staff in all aspects of 4 for 4. Weeks 3-52:  Promote 4 for 4 during Orientation at the four full-time learning sites.  (Our three detention centers will not qualify for the scholarship due to other financial arrangements with the detention centers; however, we have the correctional learners do the 4 for 4 preparation activities to improve test readiness.)Weeks 3-52:  Provide subsidies to qualifying students each week with all three counties tracking their 4 for 4 scholarship usage with reconciliations each month by a central bookkeeper.The Pearson VUE examiner will provide a monthly summary of test modules delivered at each testing site to measure increased test frequency/learner access to official testing.","GED official exams and scores will be used to measure the number of exams administered,  passed and the number of GEDs earned.

Within this project, we shall provide at minimum 94 students the opportunity to take and pass four subtests leading to his/her GED credential attainment. However, additional students may receive the benefit of support from this grant, when there are students who have currently passed one or more parts of their required subtest.

Once it has been determined that the student has met this prerequisite, the students will take all four GED-ready practice tests, which will be provided by the program, to determine their readiness to take all four parts of the GED test. Once the student has shown readiness in one of the four subject areas, the student will schedule and take the appropriate GED test. Through this method of application, we will be able to separate those students who demonstrate their readiness to be tested for graduation in 30 days from those who will need more time to matriculate. The ""GED in 30"" brings forward the conceptual framework for meeting learners where they are in their development and growth during the educational process, when working to earn their GED credential.

The Atlanta Technical College Adult Education GED program is fully funded and holds a budget of $859,700.00 to support our infrastructure and delivery model, which includes the costs for our facility, faculty/staff, professional development and most of our students supply needs. Our budget weakness is the lack of available funds within our students supply structure to purchase participant vouchers for GED testing. The building is equipped with eight (8) classrooms, three of which are computer labs. One computer lab is dedicated to all-day TABE testing and AZTEC self-paced instruction. The two remaining labs are utilized by instructors to guide additional AZTEC instructional exercises designed to supplement in-class instruction.

Literacy Pittsburgh also tracks student goals which can be as simple as ""improve English language skills"" or ""be able to read to my child"" to as involved as ""enter post secondary education"" or ""secure employment"". Goals are achieved on an ongoing basis and can take more than one year to reach. Of students who set the following goals, we anticipate these outcomes within one program year: 72% will improve their English language skills 54% will gain U.S. citizenship skills with 22 students obtaining U.S. citizenship 73% will enter post secondary education or job training  75% will increase involvement in their children's education ","Upon enrolling at Literacy Pittsburgh, students attend an orientation session and participate in an assessment and goal-setting interview. Any language barriers that might have previously accompanied the orientation process have been eliminated thanks to Literacy Pittsburgh's partnership with Global Wordsmiths which yielded 37 key documents translated into multiple languages including French, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Swahili.

Students at our downtown center can receive instruction of up to 20 hours per week, while students matched with volunteers meet for a minimum of four hours per week. English lessons are grounded in real-life scenarios such as communicating with healthcare providers and teachers, navigating the city, understanding proper etiquette for job interviews, and western workplace norms. Improving English proficiency allows students to pursue gainful employment, establish relationships in the community, and more effectively access services such as health care, financial assistance, and education.

Being available to students when they are ready to learn is vital to their success. Students receive approximately four to twenty hours of instruction per week, depending upon their individual needs, availability, and learning environment (i.e. classroom setting or tutor provision). For some students, a one-to-one tutor may be the best option to maximize learning and results, while for others they may thrive in a class led by a professional instructor. Literacy Pittsburgh's intake staff determines the best setting for students on an individualized basis, depending on where their learning levels will encourage them to flourish. ","Literacy Pittsburgh's programs are heavily evaluated and monitored by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The Department mandates the use of a specific database for student for student records and requires that Literacy Pittsburgh use certain standardized assessment tests to measure the progress of our attendance, goals attained, and entry into employment or post-secondary education. Among the sixty programs in the state funded by the Department of Education, Literacy Pittsburgh consistently ranks in the top three for its performance on a rigorous set of state standards for adult education.

The purpose of Phase Four is to serve approximately 250-300 students, of the growing population of Hispanics, needing a GED to achieve college or career goals. ESL, GED readiness training, and GED testing will be provided. All students served will prepare and test for their GED.  ","The primary goal of this project will be to provide ELL instruction based on the four modalities of English: speaking, reading, listening, and writing. The curriculum materials will contain standards for each. Goal 1. To use English to achieve academically.100 percent of English Language Learners will use English to obtain, process, construct, and communicate subject matter information in spoken and written form. Goal 2. To appropriately use English to communicate in varied academic and social settings.100 percent of students will use English appropriately in formal learning environments and to interact with written and spoken English while engaging in social interactions.Goal 3. To prepare English Language Learners to test for the GED.100 percent of English Language Learners will use English to obtain, process, construct, and communicate subject matter information in spoken and written form. Measurable outcomes will be obtained for each goal through continued monitoring and evaluation throughout the instructional and training process. These objectives will be measured through observable and measurable targets provided in the curriculum in order to attain the broader goal.Once the requested tools and instructor are in place, training can begin for these and other students. With the requested resources, the project has the capacity to serve approximately 250-300 students concurrently. Approximately 250-300 individuals will be served over a twelve month period.","Serving the growing population of Hispanics needing a GED to achieve college or career goals is the primary focus of this project. ESL (English as a Second Language) curriculum and Spanish GED preparation were previously offered during the fall of 2018. Because of the generosity of the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, Spanish GED preparation continued last year with over 300 students being served. With assistance from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, we are proposing offering ESL and Spanish GED instruction at the ABE location currently in operation that has seen the largest percentage increase in Hispanic population. According to the Pew Research Center, the county with the largest Hispanic population increase since 2000, in our six-county service area, is Forrest County. ESL tutoring, GED preparation and testing for the target audience of primarily Hispanic students, will be provided at the current ABE facility located in Forrest County.In order to meet the goals of providing ESL tutoring and GED training and testing the following components are necessary. The first key component will provide for ESL and Basic English education materials. The second component will provide TABE literacy curriculum materials, and the third will provide GED test scholarships. Utilizing these strategies and materials will allow the English Language Learners (ELL) to attain the three previously stated goals of this project.","May 2019 - Award Notification, Place order for educational materialsJune 2019 -- Material prep and instructor trainingJuly 2019 -- Continue instructor training and begin coursesAugust 2019 - Begin training students, Continuous student training begins and continues for yearsNov. 2019 -- Evaluation and submit mid-year reportApril 2020 -- Evaluation and submit year-end reportOnce award notification has been received literacy materials will be ordered. Typical turnaround for materials of this type to be received, is three to four weeks. If additional ESL instructors need to be hired this will occur in mid-June. The ESL instructors and one director will oversee the project. The ESL instructor will work eight hours per week, four hours each night, two nights per week. Students will be offered up to eight hours of instructor-led learning each week. Additional computer-based learning will also be offered. Students will begin and exit the program once the established objectives have been met. Once implemented, it is the intent of the College to continue this project after the conclusion of this grant.","Pearl River Community College ABE primarily uses the Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine a person's skill levels and aptitudes in reading, mathematics, and English. This test provides sources of quantitative data. This instrument is easy to use, has been tested for reliability, and allows for comparison among programs.Program staff are aware of the limitations of TABE when used with ESL participants' unfamiliarity with the format of the tests rather than a lack of content knowledge. Because of the limitations of TABE, a complete evaluation of learner progress will utilize other resource materials created for the program. Assessment materials found within the curriculum will also be used. These include Scoreboost, Kaplan, and the McGraw Hill Spanish GED prep books. These measures can provide vital information on learner attitudes and concerns and can be used to demonstrate progress towards their goals.ESL students are assessed at strategic intervals throughout the year. These assessments usually occur after each 10 hours of instruction. Benchmarks are established to insure progress markers are being achieved. These assessments may involve both online and manual assessment methods. Upon completion of the ESL curriculum, students having obtained the desired grade equivalent of 4.0 or higher will be administered the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine further academic needs.","Pearl River Community College has a long established and fully operational AE program. While the primary focus of the program has been in the area of HSE (high school equivalency) preparation, this project will provide for the tools needed to focus on ESL instruction and Spanish HSE preparation and testing.

This facility is housed on the Forrest County Campus of Pearl River Community College located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and has a fully functional computer lab with approximately 30 desktop and laptop computers available for student use.The Adult Education department of Pearl River Community College operates several facilities primarily for HSE (GED, HiSet and TASC) testing and training. These facilities will be available to provide students with new ESL and Spanish HSE testing services as identified in this project. The square footage space is adequate to meet the current and foreseeable future demands for services. Desk, chairs, heating and cooling are comfortable and adequate. Facilities have not been and are not currently hindering this project from moving forward.

We also know that if the parents are employed, they are likely underpaid due to their education level. The participants that we will target for this grant will have low literacy levels and not have earned their GED or High School Diploma. Part of our focus for this project is to provide parents with employability skills and opportunities for post-secondary training. ","We are unable to gain an actual percentage of the parents who have dropped out of school. We know that in Pickens County, 11.63% of residents have schooling between the 9th-12th grade, but did not complete a High School Diploma. Further alarming is that 6.16% of the community has less than a 9th grade education. Due to these high percentages, we know that we will be able to target at least 50 parents who have not earned a High School Diploma or GED. ","According to recent data, 11% of the communities live in poverty. The schools that we will be serving have a combined average of 83% of students that are on free and reduced lunch.

The communities are all listed as substandard housing.","No actual literacy rate was identified, but we know that parents that do not have their GED or High School Diploma likely have literacy skills that need to be improved. Our goal for this project is to provide support and encouragement for parents to earn a GED or Diploma in order to have a better future. Our goal as well is to provide parents with employability training so they are more marketable to future employers. Within the grant, opportunities for employability training were listed. ",,"We will be sending out an interest survey to the parents at all schools to gauge an interest in improving literacy skills and earning their High School Diploma or GED. Based on this information, we will develop classes to improve literacy skills among the parents. Our target group of individuals would not exceed 50. We will provide the classes at night and offer childcare for the parents. A demonstrated and measurable improvement in literacy will be the expected outcome. ","During enrollment, the TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) will be administered to determine participants educational functioning level. Test results will define the appropriate reading and math level. Based on this information, an individualized learning plan will be developed to ensure the adults are taught on their level. Specific instructional best practices will be used to differentiate instruction. The assessment will determine the minimum amount of hours an adult will attend class before being post-tested. Our program will follow the guidelines of the National Reporting System and place a student in the area for which they have the lowest educational functioning level. Our goal is for 50 out of 50 adults to make a measurable gain in Literacy as indicated by their level. We will also have the goal for adults who have not earned their GED to make progress towards earning their credential. We measure this by the number of GEDReady tests and actual GED portions an adult takes. In order to be successful on the GED an adult must have strong literacy skills and this program will address those areas needed to prepare them for the rigor of earning their GED. We will also work with the adults towards earning a Silver or Gold on the WIN Career Readiness Assessment. This certificate will be a valuable tool in helping our adults gain employment with a higher wage. The WIN assessment has a heavy emphasis on literacy and is a nationally recognized employability certificate.","The design of the project is to target 50 parents across the district. A heavy focus will be to serve the Title I schools in the district. Students from these schools have been academically below their peers. Close to 100% of these students are on free and reduced lunch. Preliminary data indicate that approximately 10% of the parents need additional support in literacy. Our project will focus on these parents to improve their literacy skills. The TABE test  will be administered to determine their educational functioning level. Based on the data we will work with the parents to improve their literacy with an end goal of earning their High School Diploma or GED. In addition, we will support the parents in obtaining a Silver or Gold certificate on the WIN test. In each class, the teacher will also provide direct instruction on how to work with their children at home with reading. Our partnership with the schools will enhance the parents and students educational level. With a successful completion of this program it will have a positive impact on the families, community, and school. We will be able to provide the skills and support for the parents to have a better future for themselves and the tools to provide a better future for their child.

Again, following NRS guidelines, students will be reassessed at the end of 40 hours to determine if the student has made progress in the targeted area. If a student makes sufficient improvement in the targeted academic area, the student will move to the next area of need and the student will reassess following an additional 40 hours. Students who fail to make sufficient progress will be able to reassess following an additional forty hours of specific skills instruction.

Students will be allowed to take the WIN assessment after completing up to Level 4 in the software.","Over the past two years this program has been a success because of the close-knit bond that has developed between the school personnel and parents. School level personnel were instrumental in encouraging and supporting the parents as they worked towards their GED. Parents in the program also liked the proximity of the classes and the support they received from the school and their classmates. To make this program a success, each person at the school and Adult Learning Center must embrace an, ""All Means All"" approach.We will be utilizing a maximum of four regular classrooms and two computer labs if the program is funded. The classes will be in the evening and will not interrupt regular classroom instruction. We will be using two classrooms for childcare and the gyms for activities for the children.

Volunteers are recruited and trained to be tutors for these students. The tutors are provided at no cost to the student.  The need for our Basic Literacy students is to be able to read and write and perform basic math skills well enough to successfully manage their lives and to obtain and retain a job. The range of skills can be from non-reader to high school reading level. Without improved literacy skills they are very limited in their employment choices or even prohibited from finding employment.Each adult partakes in the Intake process including pre-testing (TABE) in reading and math to determine their reading, math level or their ability to speak English (Best Plus or Best Literacy) as well as setting their personal & professional goals. Each student is post tested at the end of the year or after 30 hours of instruction.  An improvement in the TABE reading /math test score helps determine program success for a basic literacy student or on the Best Plus/Best Literacy for an English Language learner proficiency in speaking English is measured. Students will be surveyed and indicate employment status. Long term success will be for those adults who obtain and retain employment, and are able to successfully manage their lives. ",In order to make a measurable gain past practice and experience shows an adult learner needs at least one year of weekly instruction. The timeline for the Literacy  tutoring program would extend from May 2019 -April 2020. Each student would meet with his/her tutor approximately 48 weeks per year for 2 hours of instruction each week.,Each student will be given a pre-test at time of Intake into the program and then post tested after 30 hours & or at completion of the program year.

This plan guides their instruction as well as their progress. For many students, our classes are the first time they have entered a formal classroom environment. These students are grouped into pre-literate levels where basic literacy skills must be gained in order to grow phonetic awareness and the ability to read. From there, they have the opportunity to progress towards higher levels of English proficiency. All instruction is rooted in practical language skills that allow students to master the English language for daily use while also gaining an understanding of its structure. We strive to remove as many barriers as we can to empower adults to meet their individual learning goals. As with all the educational programming at Education Matters, English Connection classes are free. Students can attend classes when they are able, around their work schedules or family obligations. Comprehensive, onsite resources such as transportation assistance and childcare while students attend classes, as well as a food pantry, laundromat, community gardens, and mentoring programs through our partnership with Community Matters, are open to all students.

","The starting point for students in AEP begins with self-assessment and self-exploration. Students list their educational goals and may meet with a Case Manager to build an action plan.The second step in the AEP journey is to attend a brief orientation. Students are encouraged to ask questions, meet fellow students and staff, and tour the facilities. Most importantly, students take a baseline test to ascertain appropriate placement. Students may be placed in beginning, intermediate or advanced level ESL and/or placed in basic or advanced HSE or Integrated Educational Training, a career pathways program that combines education and training that leads to certification.The third step is classroom instruction. After a certain number of class hours, testing is conducted to determine progress. The fourth step involves more instruction and final testing to determine graduation to the next level or GED graduation. The final step is to enroll in post-secondary education, transition to the job market or enroll in IET. These are broad steps that give an overview of the path a student may take. AEP students may take financial literacy classes and take advantage of Food and Emergency Services.

Tutors provide weekly progress reports to track student activity and document their progress. When a student completes a book, they progress to the next level in their dedicated series--many will receive a new set of workbooks. Depending on the curriculum selected, a new teacher manual may also be needed. As determined by the tutor and Program Director, students are periodically re-assessed to determine the effectiveness of their curriculum based on their progression. Because our students retain their books for reference, and we consistently train new tutors, our need for curriculum is ongoing, and will always be a major financial need in our nonprofit.","The goals we have stated will occur within twelve months of the current funding request's implementation. Literacy Action students are encouraged to remain in the program as long as they feel they are making progress towards their educational objectives, so our programs are ongoing. In our experience, an active student will make measurable advancements every 3 to 6 months after their initial intake/evaluation for placement. Students meet with tutors 1 to 2 times weekly, averaging up to 3 hours for the week. In between their tutor sessions, students may be given ""homework"" to complete outside of the sessions, often a real-world application of their studies. ","1.

Expected outcomes:*	60% of students in the ESL class for beginners will advance to ESL Level I after second semester*	 100% of students in the ESL class for beginners will be assess by HAAM Case Manager for need of wrap around services.,"The program objective is to re-establish a HAAM ESL class for beginners twice a week to total of 20 participants in year  (two semesters). Those 20 participants will receive instructional materials for the course. They will also receive HAAM assistance with wrap around services that may include: Case Management, food, financial, counseling services, gas cards.  Additionally, Case Manager can assist students with: employment/education trainings. These additional services will help ensure continued participation as well as improve daily quality of living for the participants and their families.The proposed program  objectives: a) to provide Basic English language skills for beginners. b) prepare participants to enroll in a level 1 ESL class after completing beginners' class. This will help the participant to more fully engage in community and workplace activities as well as improving communication between the household and external players such as their children's teachers, service providers and others. The program is supporting participants with Case Management services to help their families at a fundamental level. Relieving the burden of paying to get to class and helping with food security will allow the participant to focus on learning.  Case management and HAAM's wraparound services will allow the program to organically help the participant and their family members to move from not only linguistic isolation but also from income instability to income stability over time.","The proposed program is designed to meet multiple objectives, as indicated a)provide basic English language skills for beginners b)prepare the participant to enroll in a level 1 ESL class after they complete the beginners class. c)assist participant to more fully engage in community and workplace activities d)improve communication between the household and external players such as their children's teachers, service providers and others.  Part of the program design is to have HAAM Case Manager assess for additional needs and provide wrap around services. This way relieving the burden of paying for gas for example to get to class or helping with food security which will allow the participant to focus on learning, or help with counseling to minimize any stressors. We truly believe that by having participants/students meet with a Case Manager and have access to wraparound services the program addresses a more holistic approach to their need for ESL beginners class.  This approach and model takes into account a multiple needs an individual may have from the beginning and supports their journey from starting to end and even beyond.  HAAM services go beyond a person completing an education class, such as ESL, or obtaining employment.  Our services prompt and foster self sufficiency with the understanding that many participants will need some of our assistance long term with the ultimate goal to become self sufficient. ",The project will begin once funding is secured and last 10 months.  Classes will be held on Monday morning and Tuesday afternoon for 2.5 hours per session.  Case Management sessions and services will be available through out the program length. ,"The proposed program/project is comprehensive and aims at addressing the needs of participants from a holistic approach.  HAAM is familiar with multiple measurement tool such as BEST oral interview, ACT Compass ESL and A-LAS Reading/Writing.  Students in the ESL beginners class readiness will be assessed through online and paper pre, interim and post tests.   HAAM's education classes, which currently includes an ESL Level 1 test students for English proficiency for oral, reading and writing grammar skills. ESL Instructor and Case Manager understand the need to assess the effectiveness of the program, students progress and also understands the importance of addressing barriers and stressors to facilitate the success of students and project. Additionally, HAAM utilizes comprehensive evaluation tools to assess Household Self Sufficiency needs.  this is the type of tool use at the enrollment and every 90 days thereafter.  HAAM utilizes a more in depth Self Sufficiency Assessment for individuals - addressing multiple domains, for example housing, child care, transportation...both matrix range from a 1 for crisis to a 5 for stability.

The DLC is passionate about our mission of making the best impact in the cities we serve. For our students and their families, the DLC's programs improve English proficiency, increase confidence in communication, encourage engagement in their children's education, and provide economic opportunity via literacy.","Our program's main intent is to help adults learn to speak, read, and write English. Students' gains on standardized tests are the most objective measure of success. The ESL students take the BEST Literacy Test. After taking a pre-test, students must attend tutoring classes for 40 hours before taking a re-test. Scores are evaluated on the National Reporting System (NRS) scale, and students are considered to be making satisfactory progress if they make one or more gains per program year. The ABE students are tested on the TABE Test and gains are evaluated according to the NRS scale. We served 70 students who were in the program for longer than 12 hours and 13 of them made one or more gains on the NRS scale.The program also aims to improve the students' lives through literacy. Realizing one now has the ability to communicate with doctors and educators or to read labels for medicines or foods, students often find their learning accelerates as they recognize their improvement and growth. Increased levels of self-esteem and confidence influence their attitude toward life overall.Individual stories written by students and tutors share how the students' lives have been positively impacted by learning and improving their English.","Our program is designed to help adults learn to speak, read, and write English. Because the majority of our students are beginner ESL levels, we focus on their needs using procedures designed to improve proficiency.When a student applies to join a class, we collect their information for our records and give them the BEST Literacy pre-test so we can match the student to a tutor or small group. Each tutor has completed a tutor training course and is monitored by the director to ensure the use of the best practices in tutoring such as accurate attendance record, slow and clear speech, and progress encouragement.After a student has attended a semester or a total of 40 hours, they are evaluated through a test to determine if he/she has made one or more gains. We have found a high percentage of students who attend consistently make a gain after attending 40 hours. The challenge, however, is consistent attendance. Out of last year's 166  students, 70 attended the minimum of 12 hours required by the Arkansas Department of Career Education to be considered an enrolled student. We need consistent attendance to meet our goals, so we have begun rewarding those with faithful attendance when they make a gain"" a certificate and a potted plant.","Our program year runs from the first of July to the last day of June (July 1-June 30). Since we have been tutoring students for two hours twice a week, we have seen more improvement than when we tutored students for only one hour twice a week. Students with the desire, motivation, and time will join a second tutor to complete eight hours per week and make faster progress. ","The BEST Literacy test is used as the pre-test and any re-tests of all ESL students. This test is a one-hour written test with three forms and is standardized when administered according to specific instructions. The re-test is given after 40 hours or a semester of instruction. We have found most students make a gain after 40 hours of sufficiently concentrated instruction (eg four hours of instruction per week).The ABE students are pre-tested and re-tested using the TABE test. This is a standardized test with two forms. Students may be tested after a semester in class or 40 hours of instruction.Because our biggest challenge is getting the students to attend consistently, we have devised several methods to encourage regular attendance. (We realize, however, life does get in the way of this ideal).","At our office in Siloam Springs, we have five to six tutoring areas large enough for small groups equipped with white boards, workbooks, and other tutor-generated learning materials.

However, Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth (TCCY) reports that youth unemployment in Davidson County is substantially higher at 15.4%. The rate is even higher for youth in state custody. As reported by Casey Family Programs, one in five foster care youth will become homeless, and one in four will be incarcerated within two years of leaving foster care.  ",Casey Family Programs reports that the drop-out rate for foster care youth is 50%.,The poverty rate in Davidson County is 16.9%. The rate for children is 22.2%.  ,One in eight adults in Davidson County is illiterate.  ,,"According to TCCY, Davidson County's biggest challenge in child well-being is having one of the highest rates in the state of school suspension, and one of the lowest high school graduation rates. A core program of YC is to help clients obtain their High School Equivalency or high school diploma. YC offers free classes; helps students establish an individual plan of study; provides one-on-one tutoring; and pays test fees. We will serve at least 30 youth currently or formerly in foster care.  ","Most children in state custody have faced trauma upon trauma. Chronic, or toxic, stress disrupts brain development and has lifelong effects on learning, behavior and health. The interplay between emotional trauma and education is striking. Trauma reduces students' ability to focus and learn academic material. Changes in living situations set students back developmentally and disrupt time in the classroom. Behavioral issues resulting from childhood trauma result in suspensions or expulsions, and more lost learning time. Students learn to shut down in school settings, believing it is better to not try than to fail. All of these issues add up and create a deficit that is incredibly difficult to overcome. Providing children and adolescents with relationships, environments and skill-building activities that enhance their executive function capacities can improve the likelihood of success in school and later in life. Utilizing the model of Trauma and Resiliency Informed Care, we work with each young person individually, to understand how past experiences have led to current behavior and we intervene in ways that are tailored to their needs. At least 30 clients will complete literacy assessments and enroll in High School Equivalency Test (HiSET) preparation or the alternate high school diploma program. Twenty students will pass two official Hiset subject tests or earn five high school credits. Thirteen students will earn a high school diploma.  ","Youth Connections provides free HiSET preparation classes on a drop-in basis, Monday through Thursday from 9:00 am to noon. The teacher also offers one-on-one instruction Monday through Thursday from 1:00 pm to 5:30 pm. The teacher is a full-time staff member with a Master's degree in education and a teaching certification. Within three days of enrollment in a HiSET preparation class, each youth completes a practice assessment to provide the teacher with the student's baseline of knowledge in order to design an individualized plan of study. We use a combination of blended learning and individualized instruction for each student. Through online programs such as Essential Education, students' skills are reinforced. Other online tools include Khan Academy, Reading Theory and Math Antics Videos. Traditional classroom teaching and workbooks reinforce the HiSET skills. All of the online teaching tools are available on the class website, which can be accessed by students wherever they have internet access. YC now also offers access to a diploma for students who have learning disabilities, test anxiety, or alternate learning styles. The Penn Foster curriculum combines online assignments with classroom teaching. Penn Foster graduates earn an accredited high school diploma. ","The timeline varies for each student, depending on transportation challenges, job demands and other responsibilities. The goal is for students to make progress toward earning a high school diploma. Progress is measured by HiSET tests passed or high school credits earned. Within three months, 20 students will have passed 2 official HiSET tests or earned 5 high school credits. Within one year, 13 students will have earned a high school diploma. Some students come to Youth Connections as many as 12 hours per week; others come sporadically. Some students complete the curriculum, take the test and pass it rather quickly. Most students need a good amount of time to fit the classes into their schedule and learn the material. The Penn Foster program gives students three years of access to instructors, online classes and materials. If a student needs to take a hiatus from the course, enrollment can be reactivated at any time during the three-year period. ","Within three days of enrollment in the Youth Connections program, each student completes literacy assessments including a literacy assessment. Based on this assessment, the teacher evaluates the student's knowledge base and learning style and tailors classes and lesson plans to their specific needs. When students are ready to take the l Practice Test, it is given on-site at Youth Connections. The Official HiSET is given at the downtown Tennessee State University campus. Youth Connections pays for testing fees and assists with transportation, to help remove any barriers to attaining high school equivalency.

HT will deliver opportunities for adult learners to interact with authors and engage in reading and writing lessons related to the authors' books. Program participants will be encouraged to attend the 31st Annual Southern Festival of Books (SFB) in October of 2019 to engage with more authors and books during this three-day, weekend free community event.In addition to targeting adult learners, HT will promote SFB throughout TN and the region through media and grassroots outreach efforts. We work closely with Vanderbilt's Robert Penn Warren Center, the Convention and Visitors' Corp, among others, to design the programming for and to draw visitors to SFB. ABE participants and other adult learners will be targeted for several of the SFB sessions. HT hosts an adult-learner website with program and SFB participating authors' information for ABE/GED programs to access to complement their lessons. HT will connect with our adult literacy partners to promote use of this with a goal to impact at least 500 adult learners (and their families) working to achieve a GED diploma. We aim to engage this audience in memorable programming that promotes academic goal achievement and encourages a desire for lifelong connecting to books and literature. We hope that these students will participate in SFB and return each year with others to enjoy this enriching literary event.","ABE/GED and adult learner components revolve around the Southern Festival Books (SFB). The Festival makes every participant feel ""welcome"" with representation of all types of authors--adding certainty that everyone can connect. The Festival is free, centrally located in the state and in walking distance from public transportation to remove barriers to entry, at the Legislative and War Memorial Plaza in downtown Nashville. As a free event, SFB very visibly supports and encourages adult lifelong learning, and our attendees take these benefits back to their homes and communities via what they heard/learned at the Festival--a greater enthusiasm for reading, and an example of engaged citizenry. Thanks to previous Dollar General grants and support, we have developed a website for GED classes to access authors and books to complement classroom lessons. This has helped to engage GED classrooms in the before, during, and after stages of SFB. HT will partner with the Nashville Adult Literacy Council and other adult learner serving groups to promote the Festival and these special opportunities. We anticipate participants will have positive experiences when engaging in the Festival and with Humanities Tennessee.","As part of our adult learner outreach work, authors will be assigned to visit GED classrooms throughout the year. HT staff will coordinate the authors' visits as they perform readings, panel discussions, and presentations at various classroom sites. Each author will spend approximately 3 hours with each class/group.We will encourage adult learners/students to bring their families to the 31st Annual Southern Festival of Books (SFB) to meet writers and seek out books to foster their reading and writing abilities. At SFB, young and adult students and their families will be offered a guided track to use to enhance their experience with the events.SFB is set for October 11-13, 2019 in downtown Nashville. Preparation and set-up of this event is year-round with the majority of the workload occurring June-September. Outreach starts in early spring when HT reaches out to Nashville area community centers, libraries, schools, and GED classrooms to promote our program options and to encourage participation.We welcome Dollar General Literacy Foundation and corporate employee participation and input to help us expand our reach and to explore creative programming and offerings for SFB attendees.","Humanities Tennessee will apply qualitative and quantitative analysis to the Festival and outreach to special audiences. Surveys will be distributed to participants after their one-on-one interaction with the authors helping the staff at Humanities Tennessee to track the participants' level of interest and to learn what was most beneficial to them. Humanities Tennessee will ask outreach participants and adult learners to ""check-in"" at a special area at the Festival to determine their participation in the general Festival. We will also ask program facilitators and instructors of these groups to offer feedback and input on how we might improve the outreach program and our program offerings during the Festival for future years to better benefit the participants. HT will record the number of attendees to the Festival and to the individual sessions and take a general poll of visitors throughout the weekend's events. Feedback from the program and website indicate that the interactive components (i.e. Festival speaker seminars) added value to GED students' GED educations and helped participants to feel connected with the community, as often GED students are new Nashville residents and immigrants. Adults who have experienced this program format reflect that ""their lives have been changed"" due to the intimate experience with an author and a book. Their interest in reading and writing has also been strengthened.","The Southern Festival of Books has been held successfully for many years in the Legislative Plaza/War Memorial space. The space works well for a Festival, allowing stages, vendors, tents and other components of the Festival to be set up easily and to move the crowd well throughout the event. Panel discussions, presentations, and other special programming occurs in special rooms that are climate controlled and offer seating, a comfortable environment for attendees as they interact with authors and writers.The ABE/GED outreach program will occur in school settings that already have the facilities and resources we require to host these sessions with authors.

(For the general population: 1.1%),The elderly immigrants we propose to serve live in public housing or are dependent on their adult children.

After 12 months of instruction, all will pass a ""foundations of citizenship test,"" acquire basic ""survival"" speaking and literacy skills, and experience a reduction in social isolation. Should the program continue until these students are eligible for citizenship, all will pass their tests. (Over the 30 years it has been in operation, the ESL Center has maintained a 100% pass rate, even for ""at risk"" students.)","7-10 students will pass the ""Foundations of Citizenship test"" (test details available on request) which includes a personal background interview, oral civics questions, and sentence reading/dictations. This test is based on authentic items/procedures used in the actual US citizenship test. Note: This project was conceived due to the reluctance/inability of WIOA-funded programs to serve elderly and preliterate students. This is because 1) learning gains of preliterate students cannot be effectively measured with the required assessment tools 2) integrating these students into classes with more educated beginners almost always results in a high drop-out rate 3) the fast-paced academically-oriented curriculum mandated by WIOA is ill-suited to the needs of elderly students, and while attainment of US citizenship is the primary learning goal of these students, WIOA-funded programs are not set up to provide this type of instruction 4) WIOA-funded programs cannot get workplace or higher education outcomes from preliterate elderly students.","Elderly students will receive formal group instruction 3 hours a week, with an additional 2 hours of reinforcement with trained one-to-one (in many cases, bilingual) tutors. Curriculum is based on civic integration and citizenship preparation goals. Activities include picture-based classroom instruction, field trips to familiarize students with the local community, TPR, songs (to  reinforce curriculum, e.g. alphabet, #s, calendar), literacy worksheets, & use of ""personal dictionaries"" & calendars. Students will learn to use technology (their own cell phones) to recognize and pronounce sight words, and to reinforce classroom learning. This curriculum is specifically tailored for preliterate elderly immigrants, is designed by an expert in ESL/literacy instruction, and can be shared on request. This initiative is conceived as a model to be shared with libraries and ABE providers that may wish to provide similar services to elderly/preliterate students. Curriculum & assessment materials will be showcased at state conferences, and interested parties invited in to observe how this specialized classroom instruction is delivered.",Project will start when funding is received and run continuously for 48 weeks. Students will receive 5 hours of instruction each week. ,"Summative Assessment: Because standardized tests such TABE, CASAS, and BEST do not measure the incremental oral and written proficiency gains that preliterate students make toward achieving the goal of citizenship, we will use a measurement tool that is specifically designed to measure learning gains of preliterate citizenship students. It is based on test items from the official US Citizenship Test that students will take once they become eligible to apply. This test was developed by a national expert in citizenship instruction for beginning level/preliterate students, and who has 28 years of experience as test development  consultant. The Foundations of Citizenship test will be provided upon request. Formative Assessment: Each student will role-play a simplified version of the citizenship interview/test each month, with increasingly more difficult test items.Placement testing: Students are asked basic personal information questions during their intake appointment. Those who are unable to respond in English (i.e. tell/spell their name, say/write their age, address, and home country) are screened into the class.","Jones Library provides handicap accessible classroom, tutoring, and office space, supplies, copying/printing, computer/internet, & administrative support. ","We will train these elderly students to use their smart phones independently as a means of enhancing their learning outside of class.

The program operates Mon-Thursday, 9am-5pm year-round. Participants engage in individualized classroom instruction each morning for a total of fourteen hours per week. Participants engage in hands-on construction training each afternoon for a total of fourteen hours per week. Participants begin the program from October -- December, with rolling enrollment in small cohorts (4-10 participants per-cohort), and complete the program from August through December, or earlier should a participant earn their GED and attain quality employment. To facilitate success, each participant completes and updates an Individual Development Plan that plots their progress through the program.MCC seeks to reach outcome 1 (participants complete their secondary education and attain their GED) within a year of enrolling in the program. While this is the stated goal, it is anticipated that additional members, who will have larger academic gains to make, will earn their GED after the one-year mark. MCC seeks to reach outcome 2 (participants will be prepared to pursue post-secondary education and/or further training in the construction field) within 30 days after participants complete the program. MCC seeks to reach outcome 3 (participants will increase their knowledge of financial sustainability) within the program year.","MCC uses multiple tools to measure YouthBuild and participants' progress, which are administered regularly to assess and guide instruction. Specific to education development, MCC uses TABE testing when participants enter the program, after two months of intervention, after six months of intervention, and at the program's completion. TABE testing guides instruction and assists staff in preparing for and timing GED testing with participants. TABE tests are administered by the Program Coordinator and Adult Education Coordinator, both licensed teachers. GED test scores are then shared and tracked to monitor participant progress.YouthBuild also uses the Pre-Apprenticeship Construction Training, which is recognized in the industry as both a credential and an assessment of math and construction knowledge. Participants complete this with a cyclical assessment model, allowing for lessons to be repeated as necessary. Post-secondary training and education enrollment is documented through partnerships with area training and education institutions. Other data collected and measured include: participant feedback, staff observations, attainment of construction certifications (OSHA 10, First Aid, HAZWOPER), homes constructed, attendance, punctuality, driver's license attainment, and employment within 1-year of program completion. MCC uses a database to track programming components and ensure staff meets participants where they are at.","YouthBuild is based out of MCC's main site, which provides efficient facilities to reach the desired outcomes. The program utilizes an office area, a dedicated classroom, and common area used for individual and small group work. MCC owns the facility.YouthBuild's home construction component is made possible through funding received from the City of Milwaukee. MCC is a Certified Housing Production Organization, making it eligible for housing funding which it has already secured for 2019 and anticipated securing in the future. This funding supports the hard costs of YouthBuild (lumber, equipment, tools, and specialized trades).Classroom instruction supplies are available in the appropriate amounts to ensure participant success. This includes instructional materials (updated within the past year), basic technology, and school supplies.",MCC uses desktop computers and a projector/screen in instruction. This technology is not used universally but is lesson dependent. The average age of the computers available is three years. There is a 1:2 ratio of computers to participants.,No,,"$307,583.00 ","$307,583.00 ","The total YouthBuild budget reflects the full costs of the program, including all staff positions, supplies, and components. It is noted that hard costs of home construction (lumber, equipment, specialty trades) are not captured within this budget but are secured and flow through a separate program budget that supports both YouthBuild and traditional housing efforts. MCC is requesting $13,000 to support staffing to deliver high quality educational services, partially supporting the Adult Education Coordinator and Career Development Coordinator salaries. This request would support high quality education, and drive both immediate education outcomes and longer term career outcomes for participants.It should also be noted that the program service fees revenue line contains funds raised through the sale of completed homes. MCC retains a small amount of revenue from the sale of each home. This profit, having been generated from granted funding originally, is eligible for reuse to continue supporting the program.

We offer a 2-hour orientation for tutors as their schedules require including evenings and weekends. We offer at least six workshops yearly to enhance the tutor's skills at instruction and offer consultation with our Education Director at any time to improve learner outcomes.3. The Education Director, tutor and learner meet together after 24 - 50 hours of instruction to discuss changes in literacy and to determine if instruction needs to be altered to better meet the needs of the learner and tutor. Post tests for increasing confidence levels are measured using the ""I Can"" assessment tool and/or through documented observation by tutor, staff, and/or instructors.  ","All tutors complete a quarterly report outlining the number of hours of instruction that occurred, what topics were covered, and an evaluation of how the student performed as outlined in their personalized education plan. At any point during the year, if a tutor feels there is little progress with the learner, the WCLC Education Director will meet with the pair, assess what needs to be done, and recommend a new educational path. The Education Director can also provide other resources or suggestions that will help with instruction.Confidence is measured using the ""I Can"" survey of confidence tool, self-disclosure by the learner, and/or tutor, instructor, and documentation of changes. Measurement of ability occurs at the start of service and again after 24 to 50 hours of tutor based instruction, or at the request of the tutor or learner.Literacy level is measured at the start of services pre-test and reassessed after 24 to 50 hours of instruction post-test using ESLOA and the DAR, and/or quarterly tutor reports or classroom teacher reports. ","The WCLC is housed at the Oshkosh Public Library in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The library provides three private tutoring rooms that tutors and learners can use. The WCLC has equipped all three tutor rooms with computer laptops, access to the internet, tools from Proliteracy, Wisconsin Literacy, and other WCLC educational materials. If all the tutor rooms are full, the learner and their tutor can meet on the second floor of the library or at a community based facility. A copy machine is located on the third floor that tutors and learners can access whenever the library is open to copy lesson plans and other information as needed for lessons or meetings. We encourage individuals meeting outside of the City of Oshkosh to utilize other publically available resources including community libraries and coffee shops. We have adequate equipment and supplies necessary to implement this project.  We have all equipment necessary to implement the services and have increased the portability of equipment to encourage community based learning.","There are now 3 laptop computers that learners and tutors can use with a variety of software for ELL and ABE learners located in rooms at the Oshkosh Public Library. Additionally, we have 2 other laptops available to check out by our tutors for lessons outside of the library. We also have access to an eight station computer lab that is owned by Oshkosh Public Library. There are also CDs, DVDs, and videos available for checkout.

Our Family Program is made up primarily of mothers with children living off the track, about 88% of whom are employed full time but only seasonally. During the months of December-April just over half of the total are unemployed; the remainder working temporary, part-time jobs while they wait for the horses to return from the south. ","The drop-out rate of the population served is close to 95%, as only around 5% of our students have studies past 10th grade. As nearly all of our students are from very poor, agricultural communities in Central America and Mexico, the majority were forced to drop out of school at an early age and work to help support their families. For this reason they have come to the U.S. in order to find opportunities for work. ","According to Census data, around 17% of Louisville residents live under the poverty level, with 22% of children under 18 living in poverty. Within our immigrant community however those rates are much higher, even though the vast number of our adults are employed. For those living on the race track, this number is difficult to estimate as they are not paying living expenses but are supporting extended numbers of family members in their home countries. Around 50% of our mothers are single mothers.","According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, in Jefferson County (Louisville) about 8% of adults lack basic literacy skills. Our population served however has significantly lower literacy rates, as nearly all of our students come from rural areas of Central America and Mexico.

Outcome: At least 5 students will participate in a new Introduction to English course, who will remain in the class for 5 months, receiving 80 hours of instruction or other English language exposure during this period. Objective 2: To offer two evening English classes for parents participating in the Family Program, with a 15% increase in attendance during 2019 as compared with 2018. Outcome: 18 parents will participate in adult English classes between the months of September-April while their children are participating in youth programming, receiving 125 hours of instruction or other English language exposure during this period.Objective 3: To offer two additional levels of instruction for high beginning and low advanced students two nights each week between May and November.Outcome: By working with consistent instructors who are trained in teaching English, retention rates for our regular classes will increase, whereby 40 percent of the total enrolled in May, or at least 25 students will still be attending classes in October. Objective 4: To offer our Conversations Partners program weekly for intermediate and advanced level students. Outcome: At least 12 conversation partners will meet weekly for 12 weeks between May and November. ","Our English program at the race track kicks off on Monday after the Kentucky Derby, or May 7, 2019. We will be offering classes from 5:30-7pm Mondays and Tuesdays, which is an important schedule to maintain as we must accommodate the demanding work schedules of our clientele, who begin their days at 4:00am every day. Racing takes place at Churchill Downs and other tracks typically Thursday through Sunday, therefore Mondays and Tuesdays are key ""dark days"" when our participants have more down time. Additionally we must coordinate classes with the Churchill-sponsored backside activities program which holds a soccer tournament from May through July on Wednesday evenings on the infield. In past years we attempted to hold classes for those students not involved in soccer, but since the tournament moved onto the infield two years ago, it has attracted both players and many spectators which really devastated our attendance on that night. Therefore we have made the decision to only hold classes Mondays and Tuesdays through July, and then add Wednesdays from August through October. Conversation Partners will meet each Thursday evening, bringing community volunteers into our Center to meet with our students for a Spanish/English conversation exchange. From the months of September-April, we also offer adult classes off-site at our Family Program location for parents with children between the ages of 2-18 who participate in youth programming each Tuesday and Thursday evening. ","As mentioned earlier, we offer two parallel programs, one on the track for those primarily living on the race track, which takes place between the months of May and November when the work force is present and the stables are full. Classes are offered on an on-going basis during these 6 Â½ months; twice weekly from May-July with 3 hours of weekly instruction, plus Conversation Partners will be available for our intermediate and advanced level students on Thursday evenings. As this is a language exchange program, they will be practicing approximately 45 minutes of English conversation and 45 minutes of Spanish each week. This program will likely have a few breaks but we estimate that it will take place for 15 weeks. During the school year, or September through April, we offer Family Programming for those race track workers who live off the track and have children between the ages of 2-18. These adult students have historically consisted of 90-100 percent mothers. This program takes place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:30-7:15pm, offering 3.5 hours of weekly instruction. Additionally we organize outside activities at least monthly throughout the year that expose our students to both language and culture within the community. These could include attending plays, concerts or other cultural presentations, going to parks, museums, etc. All students will have access to at least 3 hours at an outside event each month. ","Many BLC adult English students have limited formal education in their home country which causes a significant amount of stress when faced with formal assessments. For this reason, we have created our own less threatening assessment targeted towards  the four main domains of English language acquisition; listening, speaking, reading, writing. When students are enrolled into the program, they each participate in an oral assessment focused around the enrollment process. This allows staff to fill out a rubric on their listening and speaking performance in a relaxed setting yet real world setting. Once that portion is complete, the newly enrolled student will read a series of short stories with comprehension questions. the stories vary in reading level and will guide staff to understand the student's reading ability. Finally, the student will receive the writing portion of the entrance diagnostic. This portion includes four pictures of common but varying topics. Students are asked to write what they can about the one or more of the pictures. They can label pictures with words or write and in sentences. This entire diagnostic is given again two more times between May and October. Along with the diagnostic, students will be asked to fill out a survey measuring their confidence in their ability to use certain English language tools in their everyday lives. It will also be given three times from May to October. ","Our building on the backside of the track is our permanent home. We have a large common space with tables and chairs and other comfortable seating, three large classrooms, a multi-purpose entertainment room and a small tutoring room.

We have agreements with programs on the North and West Sides and the West Loop to provide convenient sites for our Essentials Trainings, our most frequently-occurring program. We recently expanded our training locations to underserved neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. Our locations are ideal training facilities, providing room for active participation with whiteboards and projectors. We also use conference rooms at the state-of-the-art Literacenter, a shared workspace for literacy nonprofits. We use in-house created curricula and related materials; journals; and binders of practice and record-keeping. We revise our training curricula to ensure we are incorporating well-researched and relevant content, such as Evidence-Based Reading Instruction and ESL content standards.

We maintain an online database for demographic and service data, and we use Google Apps for Nonprofits to organize and share documents.  ","While the majority of our Essentials and Special Topics Trainings focus on how to teach basic reading and writing skills, we do integrate strategies for working with learners who have technology-related goals. Recognizing that technology abilities are now essential to literacy skills, our Program Director applied to and was accepted as a prestigious NTEN Digital Inclusion Fellow for 2018. As part of this Fellowship, Literacy Works created new training and capacity building services for our members and community focusing on digital skills.

We will provide education based on a comprehensive ABE/ASE curriculum, focused on CCR standards, digital skill-building, goal setting, and case management integration. 35 individuals will advance at least one grade level in math or verbal skills over a 10-week term (50-60 instruction hours); individuals may complete more than one course.","The objectives of this program include: 1. Providing intensive education to at least 35 adult ABE/ASE learners who can identify goals to work towards during a 10-week session; 2. Ensuring that these learners advance one grade level in math or reading over 10 weeks, and remain engaged in case management; and, 3. Retaining these 35 individuals for at least one 10-week class.To be eligible, a learner must attend a program orientation, complete an assessment that demonstrates need for ABE/ASE education, and meet with a staff member for intake and goal-setting. These 35 adults are counted towards program totals if they complete at least 50 educational hours over their 10-week course, and complete monthly case management check-ins.Each student completing 50 instructional hours over each 10-week course will increase one grade level in reading or math skills in this period. Grade level gains are assessed through TABE testing upon enrollment, and at the end of each 10-week course. Students may take more than one 10-week course; however, each of the 35 student represents one unique individual. Each student will also develop a ""learning portfolio"" for each 10-week session.A critical component of this program is integrated case management. Each learner enrolled in the program will complete case management intake and meet with the CPLC Case Manager, or with an instructor in regularly communication with the case manager, at least once monthly throughout program involvement.","CPLC Intensive ABE/ASE goes beyond traditional ABE/ASE instruction by providing holistic wraparound supports for adult learners who demonstrate barriers to education or personal advancement. All individuals enrolled in this program have very low levels of education, and are unable to sustain employment; this demographic mirrors a majority of the clients currently served by the CPLC. Our goal is to move high-need adult students to self-sufficiency or self-efficacy through employment, education, or attainment of personal goals through increased literacy and numeracy skills.New learners complete an initial diagnostic TABE test in regular monthly orientations to complete enrollment. During orientation, learners undergo a holistic intake with our CPLC Case Manager, including goal-setting and individual instruction plan (IIP) development. Learners may use the CPLC space as often as they need, and can freely access technology, our library collections, digital literacy courses, workforce development services, laundry, social and medical services linkages, amenities and hygiene kits, and 1-on-1 tutoring. While learners' use of these resources is optional, they are required to attend 50 instructional hours of ABE/ASE per 10-week course.Each student will meet monthly with the case manager, or with an instructor in regular communication with the case manager or instructors to update IIPs and discuss progress; staff will hold regular case conferences to discuss learner needs.","Month 1: Begin program recruitment by: performing outreach to existing CPLC patrons and at all FIGHT locations; working with external agencies to identify candidates for enrollment; and, marketing the course on social media and email listservs, which reach a number of individuals in the target population, and encouraging partner agencies to market the program as well. Outreach continues throughout the project period.Month 2: Begin program enrollment, with each enrollee meeting with the CPLC Case Manager for intake and performing intake TABE testing. Each enrollee receives an IIP, and begins class as soon as possible. Launch first ABE/ASE class for enrollees of the proposed project; 24 instructional hours are offered per month. Offer 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, and enroll students in complementary digital literacy courses.Months 3 -- 12: Continue enrolling students, and providing educational offerings. Students begin monthly check-ins. First 10-week cohort (50 instructional hours) ends in Month 4; however, classes are ongoing through the rest of the project period.","Total number of learners, as well as class attendance, is measured through sign-ins at each lesson. All paper sign-ins will be retained, and data will be entered electronically as well.Case management sessions will be documented in detail, and files will be kept on each learner that will include case notes, meeting summaries, and case conference details. Both the case manager and the instructors will be able to edit learner files such that all staff involved in a learner's trajectory are able to contribute. Grade level progress is measured through the TABE. Learners take a TABE test upon enrollment, and at the completion of each 10-week course. Grade level progress is determined by discrete measurements of progress determined by the TABE.Student portfolios are due by the last class of the 10-week course, and are maintained in the student's file. Portfolios may be submitted in paper or electronically. At least three pieces of original written work or book reports must be included in each portfolio; length of work is determined by the student's entering grade level. Growth in numeracy will be determined by quizzes and subsequent written self-reflection on the quiz results. However, the student's self-assessment, via reflective writing, will indicate the student's level of engagement with numeracy work.","In July 2018, FIGHT launched our newly renovated Critical Path Learning Center, which transitioned a library and drop-in center into a technologically integrated learning commons.

","According to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction for the school year 2016-2017, the average dropout rate for NC counties was 1.59%. Craven, which includes the city of New Bern, was 2.15% and Pamlico was 0.68%. Jones County dropout rate was 0.31%. ","According to the US Census Bureau through July 1, 2018, the average poverty level for the state was 14.7% of the population living in poverty. For the counties served, Craven was 16.3%, Pamlico was 17.4%, and Jones was 22.3%. The average for the three counties was 18.7%.","According to the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy, the average literacy rate for the geographic area served was 15%. Craven was 12%, Pamlico was 14%, and Jones was 18%. There is no other current survey of the literacy rate in our geographical area. However, due to the increase in students requesting our services and their entry reading level, we estimate the literacy rate for our area has slightly risen over the past three years. ",,"This project will provide 1-1 and small group ABE and ESL instruction to 200 adults. Instruction is based on the student's skill level & need. NRS (National Reporting System) approved assessments will be used to measure the progress. Over 40% of the eligible students are projected to achieve a full level gain. Other students will increase their scores, get their citizenship, a new or better job, their GED, or have other positive life changes such as better communication with child's teachers.  ","Craven Literacy Council will train volunteer tutors to work with 200 adult students to deliver literacy instruction through 1-1 tutoring and small classes. CLC programs include basic literacy and digital literacy instruction.  We offer Digital Literacy classes using Rosetta Stone, Citizenship classes, workplace skills including Culinary Arts Classes, and health and financial literacy instruction. Our goal is 80% of our students will show improvement in their scores or have positive life changes.Using a collaborative approach and the NC Community College System Content Standards, tutors instruct their students at the level determined by a pre-test.  At the end of each session, tutors request student feedback to determine what the student found useful and what was not. Tutors use NRS approved assessments to measure student learning. After 40 hours or more of instruction, students are administered a post-test to evaluate their progress.CLC tracks student attendance and records instructional hours. Staff reviews the results and provides students and tutors with information concerning their progress. The curriculum may be adjusted depending on the results of the post testing. In addition, anecdotal observations and written surveys will be utilized to measure how the programs are meeting their objective. Assessments include Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) and Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE) to assess basic reading, math, and language skills.  ","CLC teaches an individualized curriculum based on each student's abilities and goals, along with using the NC Community College Adult Education Content Standards. It is a learner centered approach where the students have input as to the goals that are important to them.  Along with teaching English and literary skills, we will help students improve their job skills, get their GED, and/or prepare them to be US citizens. We work with each student to develop goals while raising a student's literacy level.  Each student goes through an intake process which includes an interview and pre-testing to evaluate their current literacy level. The Program Coordinator then prepares an individual learning plan and SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time-bound) goals for the student. These goals include leveled instruction with transition items based on benchmarks set by the NC Adult Education Content Standards.We build basic literacy skills using workforce innovation (WIOA) and occupational training materials. This includes Integrating Literacy and Career Awareness curriculum for Adult Basic Education and ESL students. While waiting to be matched with a tutor, ESL students enter a Digital Literacy Class using Rosetta Stone.  This allows students to receive instruction right away.  CLC also offers Culinary Arts Classes.  Students learn vocabulary, food safety, food handling, orientation to cooking and restaurant technique and etiquette. ","Students are pretested at the beginning of each fiscal year which will be July 2019. Total duration is dependent on the individual's learning objectives. Students and tutors typically meet twice per week for instruction for a total of 2-4 hours minimum. In the fiscal year 2017-2018, 10,124 instructional hours were logged with an average of 58.5 hours per student.  After at least 40 hours of instruction or during the last quarter of the fiscal year (April -- June 2019), a post-test is administered to the student to measure progress.  This assessment along with anecdotal observations and written surveys are used to determine the success of the instruction. Some students will have enough hours during the fiscal year that they will be assessed twice.  New Tutor Training by a team of ProLiteracy Certified trainers in a 15-hour workshop is offered 3-4 times each year. Upon completion of the course, the tutors are certified by ProLiteracy Worldwide. Professional development and in-services are offered to the tutors throughout the year to maintain their certification and keep them up-to-date on current trends.  ","The program's success will be measured as follows:1. Students will initially be given an informal pre-assessment before tutoring begins to identify their level of literacy. After 40 hours of tutoring, an informal assessment will be given to determine if learning has resulted. If so, the formal assessment will be given to the student. Success will be defined if the student has increased their scale score, and even better increased a full level gain. These results will be recorded in the student data management system. In addition, an informal evaluation will be conducted during post-assessment interviews.   2. The number of volunteer tutors utilizing informal and formal assessments to measure gains after 40 hours of instruction will be 100%. Each tutor will record the integrative content material used in their monthly reports. 3. In addition, tutors report the student attendance and number of instructional hours of each session on a monthly basis.  They also record the short-term and long-term student goals met each month.  These are recorded in CLC's database and stored in the student files. CLC uses Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) and Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE) as the principal methods to measure educational gains. Anecdotal observations and written surveys will also be utilized to measure how the programs are meeting their objective.","Craven Literacy Council operates a 2,700+ square foot facility in New Bern, NC.

The facility has one conference room, a library, and an assessment room used as needed. Less than eight percent of the total facility is devoted for staff offices.    In addition, the University of Mt. Olive offers use of their classroom space to CLC during the day.","Each tutoring space is equipped with a laptop or a personal computer.   The facility has wireless capability that allows videos and other instructional material to be viewed for additional training and instruction as the tutors and students need. In some cases, CDs are used for training materials.  Most of the educational material is through printed publications and documents such as books and pamphlets. While technology can be useful within the current space, many of our students have limited or no internet or computers at home.  The average age of our computers is four years old. Our software is on average two years old; however, it is kept updated.   While our tutors and students have laptops, the office staff rely primarily on personal computers.

We track that progress using two different systems, as described below. In 2008, United Way began using Results Based Accountability as its framework for measuring the progress of funded partners. Results Based Accountability is defined as a management tool that can facilitate collaboration among human service agencies, as a method of decentralizing services, and as an innovative regulatory process. The term implies that expected results (also known as goals) are clearly articulated, and that data are regularly collected and reported to address questions of whether results have been achieved. In addition to using Results Based Accountability, United Way needed a way to track the progress of our partners over time. For this reason, we invested in two longitudinal data systems in 2010 to illustrate results in the areas of education, income, and health ""Efforts to Outcomes -- (ETO)"" and ""Results Scorecard."" ETO is case management software. It helps organizations track outcomes for individual participants. Its reporting system allows users to make informed decisions.

","The program objective is that every student that enrolls in YBL leaves the program with a GED/High School Diploma and are prepared to enter college and/or the workforce with a marketable vocational skill. Of the 70 students who will either graduate from or begin YouthBuild Louisville programming in 2019, at least 54 will have come to YBL needing to earn their GED. With the support of adjunct faculty from the local Jefferson Community & Technical College, made possible by this grant, 44 will earn their GED. And of the 26 who either did not earn a GED or came to YBL with a High School Diploma but a skills deficiency (low entrance scores in Math and English), 19 will earn two years educational upgrades(meaning if they came to the program scoring at a 6th-grade reading level, they will attain an 8th-grade reading level before graduation). Sixty of seventy students will graduate from the program and be placed directly into college and/or employment. In addition, youth who complete YBL will earn 10 college credits at JCTC. Additional funding is requested to support the use of the Penn Foster Online Certificate and Degree program which assists students with learning difficulties in achieving their High School Diploma. Penn Foster enrollment cost is $750 per student. Enrollment in this program is expensive and not affordable for any of our students since they are living below poverty.This option allows students to earn their diploma at a pace that is suited to their learning needs.","YBL programming is distributed among three primary areas: education, vocational training, leadership and community service. The goal of the Education Component is to assist students in obtaining a GED and an education upgrade. This assists students in obtaining literacy and numeracy education improvements, and to develop skill sets for college, further vocational training and the job market. In addition to the Education Coordinator, adjunct faculty from Jefferson Community Technical College supplement the curriculum focusing on specific subjects tested on the GED. Vocation: Students will spend 40% of the time in vocational training. Each student begins with construction training and once the Pre-Apprenticeship Construction Training (PACT) certification is earned, the student can move into more advanced construction training or CNA training. Construction training is divided into four areas: 1.) Classroom Instructional Time- learning the PACT curriculum leading to a certification by the National Home Builders Association. 2.) Lab Time- where the student will demonstrate competency in carpentry and other areas in the construction shop. 3.) Job Site- where the student will function as a trained individual to build new or rehabilitate affordable housing for low-income families.4.) Leadership and Community Service- students will spend a minimum 10% of their time involved in leadership development, career planning or community service projects.","Students usually complete the program in a 32 hour per week, 40 week timeline. The first group impacted by the possibility of this funding would graduate in July, while another group of students will be actively recruited to begin in September. The students starting at the very beginning of September will graduate the following June. Throughout the program, students will be studying all subjects in the classroom, taking practice tests for the GED, and taking the four subject tests that make up the GED once ready (students who have scored above 145 on the practice test while also demonstrating an ability to pass the actual test). Students spend at least 12 hours a week in the classroom preparing for the GED and postsecondary education, while also having the option for additional one-on-one tutoring outside classroom instruction after the school day.","Short-term and long-term progress is monitored through case management and program staff entries into each student's My Success Plan, internal case management database. In order to measure each student's academic progress, YouthBuild monitors each step taken toward obtaining a GED certificate, as well as, quantify educational upgrades through the process of TABE and GED READY tests. Those assigned to work on their High School Diploma using Penn Foster or E-School are tracked by using the same database that records individual goals and outcomes. JCPS also tracks student upgrades to success through the state database. The students are tested three times during the 9-month program. Students have the opportunity to receive upgrades in Reading and Math. Student progress is also measured with GED practice tests and Ready Test. Once they successfully pass a practice test students are scheduled to take the four GED tests at nearby Jefferson Community & Technical College. Ultimately, all outcome information is entered into the federal Department of Labor Management Information System for each participant for educational, vocational, social service and placement outcomes which are reported quarterly. Housing development is measured by the Certificate of Occupancy for each completed home.","Our current 3,200 sq.ft. shop and 5,000 sq.ft. education building is equipped with a large classroom that can be divided into two smaller rooms which have 16 computers that are about five years old.

We propose to streamline our ESL, GED preparation and adult life skills education, and to add learning technology into these classes. The project will serve 25 refugees. We will increase refugees' English proficiency, which will accelerate their path to self-sufficiency. This technology will provide alternative learning opportunities in our financial literacy and computer skills classes.","The program aims to improve refugees' and immigrants' English ability by advancing their English proficiency to intermediate and high levels. For refugees who do not have high school diplomas, the project strives to assist in completing GED programs. Other objectives include accelerating refugees' integration into local communities via increased understanding of financial and job markets. We believe that by achieving these goals, refugee and immigrant clients will reach self-sufficiency more quickly.Having recently graduated all our ESL students to a higher level of instruction, this program seeks to continue expanding our ESL program reach and enhancing our ability to achieve educational goals (GED), improve the command of English, and to utilize new life skills to help integrate into the communities. This program will provide intermediate ESL education to 15 refugees and immigrants, of which we aim to see 75% advance to a higher level of instruction within the first year. The technology provided through this grant will be made available to all refugee and immigrant clients participating in our computer skills and financial literacy classes, and those working towards their GED. We aim for the students in computer skills and financial literacy courses to average a 20% increase on their aptitude tests that are a part of the program, and for the GED students to see an increase in their weekly study time by 5 hours per week through the provision of computers","This program will add significant capacity to our current ESL by catering to their diverse learning styles. We propose to add more advanced levels of instruction, utilizing the Pearson Northstar curriculum, which our instructors have utilized at the University of Toledo. Language-skills development provides students with systematic and multiple exposures to language forms and structures in a variety of contexts. Concise presentations and targeted practice in print and online build students' language proficiency. ESL classes will be synergized with GED preparation via educational counseling and use of technology. Our new GED program will provide refugees and immigrants an opportunity to advance towards GED or its equivalent. Financial literacy classes will be available to all program participants. Our approach assists refugee and immigrant families to move into the financial mainstream through a culturally-appropriate, family-based financial literacy project. It effectively removes barriers to banking, asset accumulation and consumer purchases that are facilitated by American financial systems by emphasizing technical financial literacy skills, family financial management through budgeting and saving, and financial decision-making concepts.Instructors to use the on-line interactive materials in class time. We will need three computers and an overhead projector, which will be available to students to study course materials during office hours","Due to our current ESL program's experience instructing refugee and immigrant students, the expansion of our program to implementing these changes will be straightforward and can occur within two months of receiving these funds. Pearson Northstar books and online access codes, as well as the computers and projectors, can all be ordered within the weeks directly following the announcement of this grant, with all components of the project ordered by the end of May 2019. Upon receipt of these materials, initial placement tests can be administered, and classes using this curriculum can begin by July 1, 2019, utilizing our current class schedule that offers 20 hours of instruction weekly, with most students attending class for 6 hours weekly. This schedule will continue throughout the year, and progress testing will be done quarterly in October, January, and April, again utilizing the Northstar testing interface. Once the computers and projectors have been installed, the use of this technology for computer skills, financial literacy, and GED courses can also begin, with progress testing being conducted on the same quarterly schedule as the ESL students.","To track the progress of our students in ESL, computer skills, and financial literacy courses, we will conduct quarterly progress assessments, using an assessment protocol specific to each type of course. Lower-level ESL students will be assessed using US Together's in-house progress tests, developed by our ESL Program Director. Higher-level ESL students will be assessed using the Pearson Northstar assessment tools. Our financial literacy classes utilize a curriculum designed by our national resettlement partner, HIAS, which includes assessments specific to the program. The computer skills class students will be tested quarterly using the Northstar Digital Literacy Assessment, which will generate scores for a variety of skills, including Basic Computer Skills, Internet Basics, Using Email, and more.Finally, since progress for GED students will be measure by study time, we will be requiring each of these students to track their weekly study hours and submit a time sheet to US Together for tracking and reporting of their time investment.","US Together has appropriate facilities to host these classes, including two dedicated classrooms for ESL, as well as a children's room and a volunteer base that can provide childcare, allowing single parents and parents of young children to attend classes without the barrier of childcare. Classrooms are well equipped with visual aids for teaching, whiteboards, and a variety of lower-level study aids including games, flashcards, and art supplies. In addition to these physical facilities that aid this program's implementation, we are well-suited to provide services to refugee and immigrant clients due to our interpreting program and culturally-diverse staff. Our in-house interpreting program caters to all languages served by our ESL program, streamlining communication processes, and providing a welcoming environment for those new to the country. Additionally, over 80% of our staff on-site are fluent Arabic speakers, which further eases communication, as the majority of our clientele are native Arabic speakers as well. These factors make for an environment well-suited to cross cultural communication and learning.","Our ESL program is currently not utilizing much technology for direct class instruction. Currently, this technology consists of a single desktop computer (3-4 years old) that is used for presenting digital information on a limited basis, as well as for creating and printing worksheets and other resources for class use. This single computer results in a student to technology ration of approximately 20:1, although our small class sizes mean that in each class, this ratio is closer to 5:1.

The projectors will be used during class sessions to project course material, video aids, and activities, enhancing the student learning by providing additional visual elements. The computers will be used in a similar fashion, as the new Pearson Northstar curriculum includes digital class resources, including interactive lessons, assessments, and opportunities for speaking and listening education. This technology will add an additional dimension to our ESL instruction, adding digital learning to our current oral and written learning plans. This will allow students with varying learning needs to succeed and thrive in these classes, increasing their ability to learn and retain English fluency and vocabulary. In addition to these uses during class periods, these computers will serve as an open computer lab for students of all our educational programs, allowing students to access GED study, Northstar ESL curriculum, and computer skills courses at times that suit them, allowing personal study scheduled around work, school, and other personal responsibilities, which all service as barriers to learning progress, especially within the refugee and immigrant communities.","$36,972.00 ","$36,972.00 ","Salaries include 10% of Program Coordinator salary, annual salary $44,928, requested salary is $4,492; Instruction materials include 4 sets of Pearson Northstar books/online access, $680 each, total requested $2,720; Supplies include 2 sets of projector/screen for 2 classrooms, each set $500, total requested $1,000; Computers include 6 computer desktops ($669 each), 6 computer monitors ($135 each), 6 cables ($8 each), total requested for classroom computers $4,872.

Basic instruction & a training stipend to replace school meals and assist with transportation will be provided.  The students will earn a high school equivalency credential and be exposed to post-secondary opportunities and/or employment options with a goal to become a contributing member of the community without waiting for legal adult status.,"The project objective is to address the population of students who leave a traditional secondary school option without a plan to earn their secondary credential.  A premature departure from educational instruction without a strategy to secure a basic high school diploma often creates a lapse in education that leads to minimal wage employment, escalating expenses and barriers to success.    With a referral from secondary school personnel, the project will enroll 20 students who are no longer compulsory school age and have made a recent decision to withdraw from high school.  The students will be assessed for baseline educational knowledge and adult education staff will develop a study plan for the attainment of a high school equivalency diploma.  Sixteen of the enrolled participants, with a consistent, prescribed attendance will demonstrate an educational improvement in reading, language and/or math through a Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) post-test assessment and/or a successful score on a high school equivalency subject area.  Twelve of the participants will earn their high school equivalency credential by the end of the funding period.  This objective is attainable because the project removes the lapse of time between leaving a traditional secondary school option and continuing a plan of study to earn a secondary credential. ","This project is designed to create an educational avenue for students who fall between compulsory school age and adult status.  It provides a pathway for students who are no longer required by law to attend school, complete their secondary education in a timely manner and expose the students to post-secondary alternatives such as additional academics, workforce training and employment searches.  Students with a current educational foundation can achieve a secondary diploma in a shorter period of time with minimal review.  If students present a sound foundation of knowledge, instruction can begin on a higher level.  In an educational setting that is less restrictive, our program will streamline the learning process while providing a training stipend that allows meal and transportation assistance similar to that provided by traditional schooling.  Students who have yet to achieve adult status are less likely to have employment and family commitments, allowing them to dedicate time to completion of a secondary credential.  The students will commit to an educational schedule that includes instructional time four days/week.  Upon completion of a morning class 8:30-12:00, students will receive a training stipend that may be used to purchase lunch on campus before returning to the class at 1:00.  Following a 3:00 dismissal, students will receive a second training stipend, which may be used for transportation assistance.  Fees for assessments and tests will be covered by the project.","Over the duration of a program year, July 1-June 30, the project will enroll 20 students who have been referred by public school officials.  Participants will agree to attend class for twenty-four hours/week for a period of three months.

Social studies and science will be incorporated into the instruction as deemed appropriate by the students' progress which will be determined by state approved Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) assessments, high school equivalency (HSE) practice tests and/or passing scores in the HSE subject areas.  All students will be exposed to post-secondary pathways in academics and workforce training.  Students will update and/or create an application for federal student aid as well as create an account in Mississippi Works for the exploration of employment opportunities.  Students will be encouraged to complete their HSE prior to the three month period in order to move onto post-secondary opportunities and/or employment.  Students who do not successfully complete their HSE within the three-month period will be addressed on an individual basis to identify barriers and to develop an alternate learning plan.  The students will continue to receive a training stipend through the funding period as long as funds are available.","Prior to enrollment, each student will be assessed using the Test of Adult Basic Education, version 11/12, to establish an educational baseline.  TABE is the most comprehensive and reliable academic assessment product in adult education. Educators use TABE testing to provide a solid foundation for effectively assessing the skills and knowledge of adult learners.  The TABE 11/12 tests are secure, reliable, and valid assessments used to assess the achievement of examinees on core content areas taught and assessed as part of adult education programs nationwide. The TABE test is aligned to the national College and Career Readiness Standards for the three core subject areas: Reading, Mathematics, and Language.  Students assessing at level D or A may immediately re-assess with an official practice test and/or a high school equivalency subject area test.  Students who assess at level E or M will be re-assessed with a TABE post-test after 40 hours of instruction.  Documentation of an educational gain will warrant an official practice test for assessment of success on the high school equivalency.  In the event that an educational gain is not documented following 40 hours of instruction, a meeting will be scheduled during which the student, the adult education staff and the parent and/or guardian, will be address barriers and develop an alternate learning plan.","The project will be administered and supervised by the adult education staff of Copiah-Lincoln Community College.

Each classroom is equipped with a minimum of 10 student workstations.  The primary location in Wesson has a dedicated computer lab for student usage Monday through Friday from 8:00-4:00.  The college provides administrative equipment, such as copy machines, telephone and internet services, as well as all utilities.  Supplies addressing the upkeep of the facilities are handled through the maintenance department of the college while administrative and student supplies are purchased through the adult education program.  A combination of federal and state funds are carefully managed to provide instructional resources, assessment options and documentation requirements that provide optimal impact for the students.","All students will experience the use of technology through their assessments, plan of study and/or testing sessions.

The unemployment rate by counties to be served is as follows:Autauga County: 3.3%Elmore County: 3.0%Macon County: 5.1%Montgomery County: 3.6%The unemployment rate fell 1% in December 2018.,"Alabama's high school dropout rate is the biggest threat to the state's long-term economic growth and a large reason why people in Alabama earn less than the average American. Alabama lands between 42nd and 47th in state rankings in the United States. Meanwhile, jobs requiring a higher skill level are replacing the lower skill jobs of the past especially with the rise of automotive industry now in Alabama. Drop-out rate by county: Autauga 38.7%; Elmore 40.5% Macon 43.3% and Montgomery 60.7%.",Alabama is the 6th poorest state in the nation. Fourteen of Alabama's 67 counties - all of them in the Black Belt - have a poverty rate higher than 25 percent.  This is despite Alabama's labor force being the largest it has been in five years. Poverty level by counties served:Autauga County - 12.7%Elmore County - 14%Macon County - 32.2%Montgomery County -22.8%.Working together thorough education and employment we can improve the poverty rate.,"1 in 4 Alabamians is functionally illiterate; this is the inability to read, write, or use basic math skills and technology in everyday life. It is linked with numerous social problems including crime, increased high school dropout rate, poverty, teen pregnancy and poor emotional health.  The literacy rate for the geographical areas served ranks between 21% and 25%. For the people who live in counties with higher literacy rates--it is a never ending cycle. The fight for literacy must go on.",,"Statement of Impact:Number of individuals served: 110Instruction to be provided: adult basic education/GED training and job search/placement training.Expected outcomes will include GED attainment and employment.The literacy program is designed to help low-income individuals develop foundational knowledge and skill in reading, math, and written expression, and to prepare them to get a General Educational Development (GED) credential.  ","Project/Program Objective Objectives: Number of clients to complete the literacy program and attain a GED certificationMeasurable Outcome: 20 clients will test and receive their GED CertificationProject/Program Objective: Number of clients to obtain employment before or after obtaining their GED CertificationMeasurable Outcome: 90 clients will obtain employment before or after their GED certification.Project/Program Objective: Number of clients to enroll in the program and successfully complete the programMeasurable Outcome: 110 clients will enroll in the program and successfully complete the programProject/Program Objective: Number of clients that will enter higher education institutions.Measurable Outcome: 5 clients will enroll into a higher education institution.This year alone 60% of the client referred to the program only completed grade 8 - grade 10. These young females are now in their twenties, have become parents and are facing a life of poverty not only for themselves but for their children as well. They are not eligible to apply for many jobs because they do not have a high school diploma and even if they do obtain employment, they will not be able to earn a living wage. The objective of this program is to ensure 100% of the clients referred to the program that will work to attain literacy will receive the opportunity to excel and achieve their GED Certification. ","Adult Literacy Program administered by Heritage Training and Career Center is designed to assist Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) clients in obtaining adult basic education and/or GED certification. Low levels of literacy are likely to limit life chances and may be related to social welfare issues including poverty, incarceration, and preventive healthcare. Given this, it has become increasingly important for policymakers and community-based providers to understand the literacy skills and deficits of the least-literate adults. This adult literacy program will enable every participant to acquire the necessary basic skills, reading and writing, computation, speaking and listening--to compete successfully in today's workplace, strengthen family foundations, and exercise full citizenship. Because the GED test is the most widely accepted method of obtaining a high school equivalency diploma, state and local adult educators are concerned about the effect the new changes will have on low-income and low-skilled individuals' opportunities to advance in education. The efforts of this Literacy Training Program are unique and are underway to encourage current GED students to accelerate their studies so they will be prepared for a more inclusive test.HTCC has made the adjustment for the new GED instructional delivery to help students get ready for a computerized and much more challenging GED test. The new test changes will create an opportunity to approach adult education.","The program is designed to serve clients on an as needed basis: Clients needing basic education instruction and remedial education may participate in the program for up to 1 year. Clients needing between 6 months and one year may participate in the program for that duration of time. The end result should be to attain a GED and move into the job training component to become gainfully employed.GED Training is conducted two (2) days per week, three (3) hours per day. Literacy, tutoring and GED Training preparation is conducted three (3) hours per day -- five (5) days per week.The program is open entry/open exit and clients showing exceptional progress entering on a very low level will be allowed to participate as long as needed. Job placement will be 35 hours per week in-class participation which will include supervised job search.The duration of the Heritage Training and Career Center Literacy Program is 1 year with the option of extension if needed. ","Pretest and post-test will be used to assess the effectiveness of the program. Additionally, the TABE locater test and other Adult Literacy testing modules will be used as required by the Department of Postsecondary Education to measure and tract educational gains/advancement of each participant.The locator test designed within the Adult Literacy curriculum which assesses the effectiveness for each student individually.We have partnered with the 2-year college system to ensure that the methods HTCC uses remain on the cutting edge of the national and state tools available for GED and Adult Basic Education training. TABE will be used to track education gains. The frequency of the testing will be determined by the advancement of the individual student. Students will be allowed to work at their pace, but will be coached and encouraged to move through the process as quickly as possible. Upon GED attainment client will be eligible for 1 free class at the post-secondary education level.

The area in which our students reside, which includes Nashville/Davidson County, Murfreesboro, and Franklin, has an unemployment rate of 2.3%. The unemployment rate of the Latino community in TN is 3.8%, almost a full percentage point below the national average.","Tennessee high schools have an overall graduation rate of 89.1%.  Latino students are slightly less likely to graduate with a rate of 82.6%, and English language learners have more difficult odds with a graduation rate of 70.9%. Many of the adult students in our program did not attend high school in the U.S. ","Roughly 17% of Tennesseans live below the poverty line, but Tennessee's Latino population is disproportionately affected by poverty with 24% living below the poverty line. Among the foreign-born living in our state, 22% live in poverty. Davidson County, the location of our classes and home to most of our students, is roughly representative of these rates.","According to the most recent data available, about 13% of Tennesseans lack basic literacy, and this is the case for about 12% of Davidson County residents.  46% of foreign-born Tennesseans do not speak English at a level of ""very well"" or better.  In Davidson County, this rate jumps to 66% of foreign-born residents who have not attained this level of English fluency.",,"The English Innovations (EI) program is entering its fifth year. EI targets adult immigrants with basic English understanding who are ready to advance their skills to the fluency needed for daily life. We hold three class cycles per year and two classes meet per cycle, each hosting 20-30 students, who meet 3 times a week for 11 weeks. The program serves at least 255 students annually.  The classes include digital literacy, community engagement, and civic participation.","In 2015, TIRRC participated in a national pilot of the English Innovations (EI) program along with six other sites across the United States with the goal of reaching over 1,000 individual learners within two years. We achieved that goal and have since transitioned to the full-scale program. EI is a blended social learning model that combines English language learning for adult immigrants and refugees in a collaborative, supportive classroom environment. This enables self-paced, independent learning to more than 255 adult students each year. We have designed a custom curriculum that pairs digital tools with peer support to empower students to master reading, writing, and speaking in English and equip them for returning to school or employment with an overall smoother integration experience. EI seeks to eliminate the lack of English proficiency as an obstacle to fully integrating into life in the U.S. Not only do we want immigrants and refugees to gain English language proficiency, we also want students to become leaders in their community. EI provides significant opportunities for English instruction to target populations including: immigrants in the workforce who need improved English skills to improve their employment prospects; immigrant parents who need the skills to improve communication with their children's teachers, doctors, and other caregivers; and immigrants on the path to citizenship who need the skills to integrate fully into civic life in the U.S.","Our classes serve students at the high beginner to intermediate level. Each class round, or cycle, meets three times a year for 11 weeks, and each include separate cohorts in morning and evening classes. Classes meet for 2.5 hours three times per week, resulting in over 80 instruction hours per student.  Classes are held in two locations central to local immigrant communities: the morning class, facilitated by instructor Amy Shifflett Blum, are held at the Southeast Branch of the Nashville Public Library. The evening class, led by instructor Wendy Kurland, are held at the Southeast Community Center. Each class meeting is also supported by three to four community volunteers.Each unit of the course combines real-life situations, grammar, and conversation. Class sessions include teacher instruction; students producing and practicing English content; and small group activities with native English-speaking volunteers. Students also have access to tablets which allow them to play educational games and improve digital literacy. Each cycle, students visit the Frist Art Museum and the Nashville Public Library to become familiar with Nashville's cultural resources. TIRRC organizers visit the classes to present on relevant issues and invite students to participate in TIRRC advocacy efforts. At least three guest speakers from the community, including a city council member, present to the classes about engaging in their community and how to interact with the civic process.","January 1: Outreach begins for Cycle 1Cycle 1 class dates: February - April 2019First day of classes: February 12, 2019Best Plus Pre-Test: February 12-14, 2019TIRRC Engagement Pre-Survey: February 14-20Post-Test and Post Survey: April 24 - 26th Last day of classes: April 26, 2019Weekly number of instruction hours per student: 7.5April 15: Outreach begins for Cycle 2Cycle 2 class dates: June - August 2019First day of classes: June 4thBest Plus Pre-Test: June 4-7thTIRRC Engagement Pre-Survey: June 4th-7thPost-Test and Post Survey: August 13-16th	Last day of classes: August 16thWeekly number of instruction hours per student: 7.5August 1: Outreach begins for Cycle 3Cycle 3 class dates: September - December-2019First day of classes: September 24, 2019Best Plus Pre-Test: September 24-27th, 2019 TIRRC Engagement Pre-Survey: September 24th-27thPost-Test and Post Survey: December 3-6th, 2019 Last day of classes: December 6thWeekly number of instruction hours per student: 7.5","The Center for Applied Linguistics' (CAL) BEST Plus 2.0 is the ideal program to administer and measure students' gains in English Innovations because EI classes are designed to increase fluency in English and emphasize written accuracy, but are heavily conversation-based. BEST Plus allows us to more accurately measure students' oral and comprehension of the English language, and uses everyday language that reflects life in the U.S. to assess students' interpersonal communication. Oral assessments are done one-on-one in which the instructor ranks the student's answer to everyday questions such as ""How did you get to work today?"" We will administer the BEST plus tests during the first week of each cycle and again during the last week of the cycle to measure gains. Along with BEST Plus 2.0, we administer our own survey to measure student's improved fluency, confidence, and understanding of information and civic resources available to them, as standardized testing does not capture this data. As with the BEST Plus, students take our engagement and skills development survey twice - once in the first week of classes and once during the last week. This survey asks questions like ""In the past month, have you visited a library or community center?"" or ""Do you feel confident finding resources and information in English online?""and students respond on a scale of 1-5. This assessment gives us a better picture of the overall efficacy of our program.","Because they are easily accessible to our students and are already community-based institutions, the Southeast Community Center and the Nashville Public Library Southeast Branch make ideal class sites for our program. The spring 2019 cycle is our first time partnering with the library in this way, which allows us to meet the need they have been experiencing in the form of many calls and inquiries about English classes. Both locations interact with large audiences of immigrants and refugee on a regular basis, and are centrally located amongst large foreign-born populations according to MNPS data. The Community Center hosts our daytime classes, and the library hosts our evening classes. As our students are adults, it is important that we provide morning and evening classes to accommodate a variety of schedules.Both facilities provide us with a private classroom with appropriate space and seating for our classes. Classroom space is equipped with wireless internet, and the library space features a projector with a large screen and plenty of space for breakout groups. We make use of flip charts and easel pad markers to enhance group projects and discussions.","Thanks to our relationship with the nationwide organization National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA), we have a number of Samsung Galaxy Tab S tablets available for students to supplement classroom learning. Right now we have enough tables for two thirds of students to work with a tablet at one time. The tablets provide students with the opportunity to improve their digital literacy by practicing navigating the internet, using email, and searching for information, as well as practice their English with apps such as Duolingo. In class, we also use laptops connected to projectors to provide a visual supplement to instruction and enhance reading comprehension.

First, we utilize a competency-based model and institute a student-directed instructional approach. Integrated English (IE) covers the core immigrant integration areas of civic knowledge basic job skills, digital literacy, and financial literacy -- all while improving English literacy in a contextualized classroom environment. The primary IE text used is the Ventures ESL textbook series and online activities. PODER-designed modules on the other above mentioned content areas covered in class are used by instructors and tutors to support student language acquisition. As students progress through the different IE levels, the classroom content progress to topics such as academic goal setting activities, building workplace vocabulary in English, and role playing activities to simulate English language job interviews, naturalization interviews, and parent teacher conferences, among others. PODER has a comprehensive Educational Standard Guide that guides instructors throughout the academic trimester to ensure students are reaching milestones in 1:1 sessions.","PODER's outcomes will be accomplished in our FY2020 (July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020). All students receive six hours/week of instruction (total of 60 instruction hours per trimester).

Our IE Program Manager is responsible for ensuring all students take the BEST Literacy exam on schedule -- at intake (0 hours) and then after completion of 60, 120, 180, 240 instruction hours. In Fiscal Year 2018, 72% of post-tested IE students gained at least SPL level after 60 instructional hours. Given the limitations of any standardized exam to fully assess learning gains, PODER also utilizes an internal grading method. Successful completion of an IE level is determined by the following grade breakdown:  20% homework (ex: quizzes, community activities, independent learning activities); 25% oral midterm; 15% written midterm; 25% oral final exam; and 15% written final exam. In order to pass an IE level, a student must achieve a grade of at least 80%. In Fiscal Year 2018, 80% of retained IE students passed an IE level. Additionally, we measure all students growth in self-efficacy areas, such as civic engagement, digital literacy, and financial literacy.

Assessment will include the gains students make on standardized tests, the digital literacy certificates they acquire and the number of personal goals they meet","The development phases of our project are scheduled to begin at the start with the new fiscal year July 1, 2019 thru June 30, 2020. The goal is to achieve our  outcomes in terms of student gains and improvement for FY20.  ABE students, we expect 110 / 145 students to make gains on TABE tests within FY20. The ABE students will receive 12 instructional hours per week in 12-week sessions. ESL students, we expect 130 / 150 students to improve scores on the BEST Literacy.  ESL students will receive 6 instructional hours per weeks in 12-week sessions. GED student gains will be measured on less of an incremental basis and will be determined by the number who pass the GED exam or sections. The outcomes projected for this student population are sought to be achieved a full year after the implementation of our project. Within a year we expect to see over half of the class, or 35 individuals, to either receive GED or pass particular sections of the exam. Lastly, the new Basic Digital Literacy program, we expect 135 students -- mostly ABE learners -- to earn one or more certificates from the Northstar Digital Literacy Project in various digital literacy categories within the first 6 months of implementation. In order to reach that outcome, Basic Digital Literacy students will receive 6 hours of weekly instruction in 12 week sessions. It is LC's hope that the project outlined thus far will persist indefinitely as a fundamental new aspect of our adult education services and approach  ","Standardized pre- and post-testing, each program is assessed differently. ABE students take TABE 11&12 to measure basic skills in reading, math, language, vocabulary. After every 40 hours of instruction, which amounts to every four weeks. As for our GED students, after 40 hours of in-class instruction they are assessed using the TABE 11&12 to measure both basic and advanced skills. ESL students of all levels are assessed after 60 hours of in-class instruction, or about every nine weeks, using BEST Literacy. With the introduction of BDL program, students will be tested every 40 hours of instruction and will be assessed using Northstar modules in the areas of computer basics, internet, Microsoft Word, email,  and Microsoft Excel. Also, with the establishment of the computer lab a number of assessment tools that are computer-based and require internet access will become available to LC. For instance, we plan on using TABE-PC software to assess both GED and ABE students. Doing so will allow instructors to more accurately analyze and record student results. Additionally, with a computer lab we plan on using BEST Plus, a computer-based assessment, to measure ESL students' listening and speaking skills. Students are also evaluated by staff, instructors. One on one evaluations are designed to help and determine a student's level, approach and learning style. Part of LC's approach is a personal relationship with our students to help achieve their individual goals to achieve "," Literacy Chicago facility is centrally located in downtown Chicago and with easier access to public transportation for our students. Literacy Chicago's offices are in a shared facility called the Literacenter which comprises of over 135 literacy organizations. The facility is comprised of individual offices and cubicles; while sharing dozens of conference rooms, classrooms with smart boards, conference calling equipment and classroom tools. In addition, as of January 2019 the Literacy expanded its space to include an additional 10,000 square feet of classroom, conference rooms and offices. This shared environment creates collaborative opportunities amongst fellow non-profit literacy organizations. Besides our in house facilities, partnerships with outside organizations, libraries, schools and churches have allowed Literacy Chicago to expand programs in neighborhoods we can assist those adults in need of our services. One example of an offsite partnership is with the Harold Washington Chicago Library -- which adds both easy access and hundreds of new literacy resources and experiences. Both our ABE and ESL adult learners attend classroom sessions between Mondays through Thursday from 9am to 4pm. In April of 2019 Literacy Chicago will be expanding our adult programs at the library to include digital literacy courses. All courses are conducted and monitored by Literacy Chicago's staff","Our current technology access is available in our classrooms for the instructor to use in presenting their lesson plans. However, student access is limited at our main facility. Over the past few years we have been able to upgrade and purchase computers for our digital literacy courses, but the demand for the course has outweighed our equipment availability. Current ratio is 1 computer for every 5 students.  Partnership have allowed student to utilize offsite computer labs to assist with the homework and career preparation. One of Literacy Chicago's partners is with OAI Inc.  Literacy Chicago's advanced GED classes are held at this facility which has a lab and is made available for students use.

This fellowship granted us the ability to create a robust and interactive curriculum for our students within our core ABE, GED and ESL programs. Digital learning has now been incorporated within all of initiatives, as well as providing digital learning programs to our low literacy students as well as seniors within the community. Funding dollars would provide 10 lap tops, software updates, and the tools to continue and enhance our curriculum and staff. As of 2018 with the rollout of our two new digital literacy classes (Beginning and Intermediate) we had to create a waiting list since PC equipment is limited. Currently we have one computer for every five students looking to enroll in our program. Funding will assist in the reduction of the student wait list. Partnerships with OAI and the Harrold Washington Library also have offsite PC Labs that our students can use, but are not always convenient based on location and availability. GED students will be provided with tools and techniques as they prepare for their GED exams.

","Students ""graduate"" when they pass all 8 GED tests.  The average student takes 18 months, but could be shorter or much longer.  We have 50 students enrolled and graduated 8 in 2018.  Our GED enrollment was 25 in 2017 and 50 now, probably increasing in 2019.  Considering students who have not attended in a year as having dropped out, we calculate the drop-out rate as 26%.","In 2017, the Kentucky poverty rate was 17.2%.  We work in Scott and Fayette counties.  The poverty rate for Scott County was 10.4%.","The National Center for Educational Statistics says that 7% of the population over 15 years old lack basic literacy in Scott and Fayette Counties, KY, in 2003.  This indicates that 93% are literate. ",,"In 2017, we served 25 GED students only in Scott County.In 2018, we expanded to much larger Fayette County (Lexington) and now have 50 students enrolled.  We have two 2-hour classes each week in Lexington, and one two-hour class in Scott County (Georgetown).  We graduated 8 students in 2018 and expect to graduate 12 in 2019.","Our 2018 request  said that ""we will be able to provide a viable long-term GED in Spanish program for this area of Kentucky"".  We did that in 2018 with what remained of 2017 Dollar General funds.  We are the ONLY established GED in Spanish program in our area, although other efforts are made and fizzle out - even the Federal programs (which cover agricultural migrants only, and we have few agricultural migrants in our area who are interested in GED).  Our program cost $16,579 in 2018, and we will maintain that spending rate.Now we have a viable, long-term program with 50 students enrolled.  More students enroll as word of our program spreads.  We are going on local Spanish radio to tell about our program -- even though we are close to full capacity right now.  The classes cover different subjects, so students attend the class relating to the next GED test that they're trying to pass.  For example, a student preparing for the Math GED would attend only on Mondays.We have a Facebook page, ""Georgetown GED en espaÃ±ol""  which has photos and videos of our current classes.  Specifically, our goal is to maintain a GED in Spanish enrollment of around 50 students and to graduate 12 in 2019.Each of our graduates must pass 8 GED tests (4 preliminary and 4 final).  In 2018 our students passed 59 tests.  Our goal is for them to pass 96 tests in 2019.","Local libraries allow us to use their rooms, copiers, etc., but will not permit us to charge students for anything.  Georgetown College lets us use their computer rooms to give GED tests, so routine expenses are low.  Our primary costs are therefore for our teacher, who are the focus of our program design.  We only get good teachers, week after week, if we pay them well and treat them with the respect they deserve as being the heart of our program.Our class sizes average about 24 students, who vary widely in skill levels.  Each class focuses on one of the four subjects of the GED tests.  We found that we need to split each class into two levels - one group for entry skills needing long training, and another group for final preparation to take the GED tests.  We therefore need two teachers per class - who must be fluent in Spanish.  We have four teachers with college degrees - two from Cuba, one from Mexico, and one from the University of Kentucky.  One teacher doubles as Administrator to schedule the classes & teachers, pay them, keep statistics, and schedule GED tests.Those are the only paid people in the Immigrant Initiative.  The Administrator reports to the Board of Directors and is one of three people with access to our accounts, kept in the Kentucky Bank but tracked and categorized in QuickBooks Online.  The Treasurer is on the Board of Directors monitoring the other Immigrant Initiative programs, prepares tax reports and writes grant requests.","This is an ongoing program.  We doubled in size in 2018, and now seek a stable year as the only ongoing GED in Spanish program in Kentucky.  We will give three two-hour classes per week in three different locations -- two different libraries in Lexington, and in the basement of a Georgetown College building, where there are computer resources.","The goal of this program is to get immigrants to pass the GED tests, allowing them to climb up from manual labor to higher skills.  Our students come from widely varied skill levels and many have limited computer skills -- yet the tests are given online.  Success with computers means being able to pass the online tests.  Passing tests and getting the GED certificates are the only things that really matter, and these can be measured.  Our Administrator takes attendance -- but the number of classes attended is not a goal.  The sooner the tests can be passed, the better.  A by-product of our classes is Adult Basic Education in Spanish.  We have a number of students who are at a low level and will probably never pass the GED tests.  We keep them in our program to help them get the skills needed in America, but do not measure their progress unless they decide they are ready to take the GED tests.  We give framed graduation certificates at a small party to honor our graduates.  The certificates have no legal value, as the real certificates come to students' homes by mail -- but it is motivation to others and gives something to put on the wall.","We have two two-hour classes per week in Lexington and one in Georgetown.  The Lexington classes are in the Village Branch Library (in the middle of a Hispanic area) and in the North Side Library.  The libraries have one large room each, but can only schedule us for one day per week.  They both have overhead projectors, copiers, and whiteboards.  They have computers but we must share with other library patrons and we can't reserve them for long periods required for GED tests.Our third class per week is at Georgetown College.  They have a classroom available and a computer room.  See below ""Available Technology"" about computers.","Georgetown College lets us use a computer room with six computers.  That is not enough for our practice and final tests, so we bought two laptops which we put in their computer room and which BCTC students can use when we're not there.The student to technology ratio at our Georgetown College location is eight computers (six of theirs and two of ours) for a 24 student class.  We have two instructors per class, so one teaches in a regular classroom while the other teaches in the computer room.  Most of our students live in Lexington, so they don't come to Georgetown until they are close to taking the GED tests online and need the computers.  We buy a GED in Spanish book online for the students, so classroom work with a book, paper, and a whiteboard is effective",No,,"$14,250.00 ","$17,900.00 ","The State of Kentucky will not fund educational programs which are not in English or to learn English, so we cannot get any Kentucky funds.  We use public library classrooms.  The library will not allow charges for programs - so we cannot charge our students for classes.  We usually get $500 from our county government, but no other government funds.  Contributions consist of $500 from churches and the remaining $6,500 from philanthropists.Our primary funding normally comes from Toyota (a factory nearby can use the workers) and from the United Way of the Blue Grass (UWBG).  We have been notified that Toyota's grant will be slipped three months due to an accounting change.  No Toyota funds are expected in 2019, but they will come in January 2020.  The delay in Toyota's normal $5,000 grant until 2020 is why we show a deficit in 2019, but we expect to be in the black in January 2020.  The Dollar General Foundation $2,500 grant is especially important to help cover the shortfall in late 2019.The ""salaries"" are hourly pay for our four instructors and our Administrator (who is also an Instructor).  No one else in the Immigrant Initiative is paid a salary - all are volunteers.  About 30% of Immigrant Initiative funds go to activities other than GED in Spanish, so splitting out where the funds come from is subjective.  Overall, we expect to lose $10,000 in 2019 but get well in January 2020 with Toyota funds.  We have reserves to cover the shortfall.",38.3128546,-84.5785937,KY,True,True,15.375,23.0,20.0,8.0,24.0,1.0,34.0,7.0,6.0,24.0,20,10.0,Red

Every six months, we also monitor program effectiveness by reviewing the number of tests taken by students in the HiSET program and reviewing number of tests passed.  In the same timeframe, regarding ESL effectiveness, students are measured based on number of units successfully completed.During the intake, at graduation or at least annually, in order to assess self-sufficiency, students take tests which assess social determinants in areas needed to not only advance in Begin Anew's programming but to progress and learn in the world around them. Within the HiSET program, in order to assess the appropriate curriculum level required for each student, the CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems) test is used to measure each student individually for placement purposes. Practice tests, curriculum progress and teach recommendations determines when the student is ready to take the HiSet test.  ESL utilizes oral and written assessments to determine Level 1-3 placement and graduation status.Testing for both programs as described, takes place initially and throughout the student's education.Upon taking the HiSET and successfully passing course requirements, students receive verification stating the course has been completed.

It is this population that OIC targets with this its PreLiterate ESL class.","The dropout rate for Oklahoma's largest school district is as high as 13%.  However, it is worth noting that USDA Economic Research Service confirms that 30.6% of adults in Oklahoma County do not have a high school diploma.  Despite Oklahoma's unemployment rate being below the national average of 4.1%, low literacy rates present a costly obstacle to employability.  Residents who suffer with lower literacy skills may find themselves employed yet still unable to earn a living wage.","The poverty rate in Oklahoma County is 16.4%.  Overall, the state poverty rate is 18.4% (US Census Bureau, 2016).  Over 21% of Oklahoma County residents speak a language other than English in their home.

Similarly, many hours of instruction are needed to attain the student's learning goal.","Project READ staff will complete these activities: * Volunteer recruitment: Project READ recruits volunteers online as well as through newspaper articles, local businesses and event involvement.  * Tutor training: Project READ staff prepare volunteers to instruct students with a free six-hour training session, offered monthly. * Volunteer Placement: Volunteers are matched with a low level reader, GED student or ESOL student. Students receive one-on-one instruction 2-3 hours per week. Tutors and students mutually agree on a time and public location for tutoring, such as a library. Project READ staff frequently check in with tutors and students to ensure a good match and to offer use of tutoring materials.  * Measuring student progress: Project READ collects assessment data from classroom sites, which avoids duplicative testing and increases communication and collaboration between the student's classroom learning site and Project READ. Student data is collected primarily from the two largest providers of literacy classes in the Dayton area: Miami Valley Career Technology Center (MVCTC) and the Kettering Aspire Program. If a tutored student is not involved in a classroom learning program, Project READ staff administer the testing. Long-term outcomes (such as earning a high school diploma or GED, gaining U.S. citizenship, obtaining a job, or entering postsecondary education) are collected from the students and tutors and from classroom learning sites.","The Adult Literacy Tutoring program is an ongoing program for Project READ.  Project READ staff will engage in the primary program activities (recruiting volunteers, training volunteers, matching and managing tutor-student pairs, and measuring student progress) simultaneously throughout the 12 month program year.  Volunteer training is offered once per month during the traditional school year. Pre-tests are administered as students enter the program and post-tests occur after 40-60 hours of instruction (for ABE and GED students) or 60-80 hours of instruction (for ESOL students) or prior to program exit, as mandated by the Ohio Board of Regents. Students receive one-on-one instruction 2-3 hours per week through this program.  Project READ staff collect anecdotal student learning outcomes from tutors and students monthly and pre- and post-test scores from partners at the end of the calendar year as well as at the end of the program year, at minimum.Project READ anticipates that all stated outcomes will be achieved by April 1, 2020.","The following assessments will be utilized to assess student learning/program effectiveness:* Washington 13: The Washington 13 is a screening tool for learning disabilities. The Washington 13 is administered by Project READ staff at intake to determine if further testing for learning disabilities is necessary. * Tests of Adult Basic Education (TABE): The TABE is a diagnostic test used to determine a person's skill levels and aptitudes. The TABE is administered at intake to determine ability levels in various subjects. It is administered again, as a post-test, after 40-60 hours of instruction or prior to program exit.  * Basic English Skills Test (BEST) Plus: The BEST Plus is an individually administered face-to-face adaptive oral interview designed to assess the English language proficiency of adult English language learners. The BEST Plus assessment is administered at intake to determine English proficiency. It is administered again, as a post-test, after 60-80 hours of instruction or prior to program exit.  * The TABE Complete Language Assessment System--English (CLAS-E): The TABE CLAS-E assesses the language proficiency of non-native English language learners in the areas of reading, listening, writing, and speaking.  The TABE CLAS-E assessment is administered at intake to determine English proficiency. It is administered again, as a post-test, after 90 hours of instruction or prior to program exit. ","Project READ is based at Sinclair Community College and shares the Sinclair Community College Foundation's 501(c)(3) designation. Sinclair provides ample office space and administrative support to Project READ at no charge to the organization.  This in-kind contribution from Sinclair provides Holly (and the rest of the Project READ staff) with the space and equipment needed (such as phones, furniture and computers) to manage the Adult Literacy Tutoring program.As noted above, the volunteer tutors meet with their students at a time and location of their choice, so no tutoring takes place in Project READ's office. Most students and tutors meet at local libraries, churches and other suitable public locations for their tutoring sessions. Project READ even has informal agreements with local businesses, such as Starbucks and Panera Bread, so that tutors and students can use their facilities for tutoring without obligation to make a purchase. This flexibility allows students and tutors to agree upon a mutually convenient time and location. ","Because tutoring is community-based (and therefore does not occur onsite), Project READ does not provide technology for tutors to utilize during instruction. However, some tutors may choose to use technology during their tutoring sessions. During volunteer training, Project READ recommends the following websites as resources for tutors:* Kahn Academy (mostly recommended for GED students with math needs)* Mango Languages (free Rosetta Stone for ESOL learners)* www.freeology.com (graphic organizers and manipulatives)* www.ged.com (for tutors of GED students)* www.typing.com (for tutors of GED students with no keyboarding skills)* Ohio Department of Education/Ohio Board of Regents website (for state standards and benchmarks)* www.englishgrammar101.com (recommended for all students needing assistance with language and grammar structure)* www.newsela.com (current news media site for nearly all learners; access to articles in various grade levels)* http://www.ldoceonline.com/ (an online version of Longman's English Dictionary used for ESOL learners)* www.readworks.org (can be used for all learners; various fiction and non-fiction stories in various levels)* welcomedayton.org (the city of Dayton's website for inviting immigrants to the city and connecting them to resources)* daytonmetrolibrary.com (for tutoring resources available at local libraries)",No,Not applicable.,"$66,559.00 ","$66,559.00 ","This grant will support the salary for Project READ's Education Programs and Outreach Coordinator, Holly Elkins-Lopez. Holly's leadership is critical to the program's success because a volunteer manager is necessary to recruit, train and manage the volunteers as well as to determine program outcomes. Holly spends many hours per week recruiting volunteers and responding to new volunteer inquiries. Holly offers a volunteer training course (six hours in length) once per month during the traditional school year to prepare new volunteers to join the program. Matching students with the right tutor also takes a significant amount of time, as finding just the right match can be a challenge. Holly also spends many hours each week communicating with volunteers and students, offering support, guidance, and materials (including tutoring materials purchased with support from past grants received from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation).Project READ is located at Sinclair Community College; there is no rent.Income for this program is anticipated from a variety of sources. Project READ has already secured support from Virginia W. Kettering Foundation, Vectren Foundation, and United Way of the Greater Dayton Area.

The overarching expected outcome is that the students will be more comfortable interacting in society where English is the dominant language.","The principal objective and anticipated outcome of the Civics and Citizenship program is for the students to gain knowledge of how society in the U.S. operates in regard to the laws and norms of the community. The immigrant students will understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens in the U.S. The objective for students who are seeking citizenship will be to pass the Naturalization Test.We will measure the outcomes of the program based on the successful completion of modules in the software program Burlington English, and citizenship seekers will be measured by passing the Naturalization Test.","The Civics and Citizenship Program builds upon the success of the English Literacy and Civics Program that Dollar General provided funding for in 2018. We will continue to administer the program so that immigrants will have an opportunity to learn real world civic skills related to living in the U.S. The difference with this year's program is that we will be prepared to assist immigrants who are seeking to become U.S. citizens by helping them pass the Naturalization Test.We will use the software Burlington English and students will have a ""seat"" in the digital classroom. The class is designed to improve a person's English for tasks related to a variety of civics topics.Students who are studying to pass the citizenship test will use paper textbooks from NewReaders Press with their volunteer tutor. These textbooks cover the topics on the citizenship test and the questions in the personal N-400 interview.Our Technology Instructor will track progress and engage the students as they complete the modules in the course. Students will move through the modules in Burlington English at a self-directed pace. The Instructor will also bridge the content the student is studying to the work that the student's volunteer tutor is doing. (The students in our program meet with a volunteer tutor one day per week.) This will give the student additional language practice. Lastly, the Technology Instructor will monitor and administer assessments that are a part of the digital course.","Our ESL program has open enrollment, and each student starts the program at different times. We currently measure the duration of the program as 40 hours of instruction. We offer the option to continue in the program after that time is met if it benefits the student and he or she can continue.  We have found that it takes approximately six months to complete 40 hours of learning. Each learner is on a different schedule to receive instruction because the students come in when it fits their schedule. The student begins the program by using the Burlington English software at the Center and at home if the student has a computer.  After recruiting and training a volunteer tutor, the student is matched with the tutor and receives language tutoring one day per week for two hours. Thus, a student can receive four hours of instruction per week, two hours using the software and two hours with a tutor.","CASAS Life and Work reading test will be used as a pretest and posttest tool. The National Reporting Service recognizes the CASAS reading test. The CASAS testing system measures student gains by Educational Functioning Level, and the learners' test score places them in one of eight categories. The categories range from the low end ""Beginning Literacy/PreÂ­Beginning ELL"" to the top category, ""Proficient Skills."" There is a numeric range for each category. For example, the score range for ""Low Intermediate ELL"" is between 200 and 210. We will track educational gains after 40 hours of instruction and beyond at 40 hour intervals.We will use assessments and progress reports generated from the Burlington English software to assess the students' knowledge and proficiency. The assessments from the software will also be used to guide instruction. The reports and the number of hours the student uses the software will be analyzed to determine effectiveness of the program.","We have adequate space (approximately 2,000 square feet) to serve the students in our program.

","The Director, Education Coordinator, and Instructors at the Mother Veronica Resource Center structure programs to optimally meet students' needs.  For the current 2018-2019 year, the Director and Education Coordinator have set the following projections:ïƒ˜	All participants in the ESL classes who consistently attend classes will begin to communicate in and speak English confidently.ïƒ˜	85% or 121 of the ESL students will successfully complete both semesters of ESL classes and demonstrate advancement in English language speaking, reading, and writing skills.ïƒ˜	At least twelve students who are in GED preparation classes will attain their GED.ïƒ˜	At least five Citizenship preparation students will pass the Naturalization Test and attain U.S. citizenship.ïƒ˜	All participants in Computer training classes who consistently attend classes will attain basic computer and Internet skills.ïƒ˜	At least two advanced ESL students with professional qualifications in their native countries will achieve a level of proficiency that will enable them to enter their fields of expertise in the U.S. ","After two semesters of an ESL course, most students move to a higher level of instruction.  Those who return pick up where they left off in the Pearson Side by Side series.  For most this means an advancement of one full level.  Upon registration, for new and returning students, an assessment is administered to determine the most appropriate placement level.GED preparation classes for Language Arts and Mathematics are offered in both English and Spanish.  Students prepare for each test (Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science) separately.  Students can take the GED Ready Practice Test in each area at the Center, and when they qualify, they take the actual GED Test.  If they pass they move on to prepare for the next test.  If they do not pass, they continue preparation for that test, following suggestions from the GED Ready Report, while at the same time preparing for the next test.

At the end of each 12-week semester, students receive a certificate of achievement stating the level completed or skills attained.  Students participate in ESL classes two days per week for a total of three instructional hours.  Since language development is on-going, there is no time limit for achieving proficiency.  Students can re-register for another year of instruction at the same level if they so choose.  Thus, they can advance according to their personal goals.  Most GED in English students attend for four days a week, two for Language Arts (Reading and Writing) classes and two for Mathematics classes for a total of six instructional hours.  Most GED in Spanish students attend for three days a week, two for Language Arts and one for Mathematics classes for a total of four-and-a-half instructional hours.  GED students are encouraged to come to the Center to do additional independent computer study at their convenience.  GED students advance and test as soon as they pass the GED Ready Test in each content area.  For some, this may take as long as two years; others may be ready to test after some review lessons, depending on their educational background.

We also have one tutoring student who passed TOEFL this year.  The programs are also evaluated by the participants.  They are asked to provide feedback on goal achievement, as well as satisfaction with the services provided.An initial skill-level assessment provides a benchmark for measuring student progress.  Students' advancement in the classes is closely monitored through informal assessments and formal testing on an ongoing basis.The Education Coordinator has incorporated the ESL curriculum series, Side by Side, into all levels of ESL instruction.  Along with other assessments, the Side by Side final tests for each level of the program are used to help determine student proficiency and measure student progress.

There are no accurate statistics available focused specifically on the Latino community. The Department of Labor does not maintain statistics for employment by ethnicity, but the unemployment rate for Latinos, who tend to be less educated, lack English skills, and are often employed in seasonal labor is almost certainly higher than the overall employment rate.","According to the Tennessee Department of Education Report Card for the 2017-2018 academic year, the drop-out rate at Knox County Schools was 1.4%. However, the graduation rate for Hispanic students is only 83.3% and for English Language Learners it is 78.7%. Sixty percent of the Adult English Language Learners in our programs have less than a complete high school education from their countries of origin. ","The 2017 American Community Survey estimates 15.8% of Knox County residents were living in poverty, while 29% of Hispanic/Latino community members live in poverty.","A 2003 study of literacy rates by county in Tennessee found Knox County to have a 9.9% illiteracy rate. Nationwide, the Pew Foundation has reported that between 35 and 39% of Hispanic immigrants from Mexico and Central America have a ninth grade education or less, and it is reasonable to assume that literacy rates for the Hispanic/Latino population are lower as well. Within the Hispanic community, illiteracy is particularly common among Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants of indigenous descent.",,"The morning English as a Second Language program provided by Centro Hispano de East Tennessee will enroll 75 individuals. The students will take part in high-quality ESL instruction to empower them with the tools necessary to effectively communicate. With this invaluable skill, the students will be able to confidently navigate their daily lives and further their employment opportunities. ","The objective of the morning English as a Second Language Program (ESL) is to teach English to Latinos so they may improve their job opportunities and increase participation in the community. Nationwide, nearly 1 in 10 working-age U.S. adults are considered to be limited English proficient, and these adults earn 25-40% less than their English proficient counterparts (Brookings, 2014). With the 2018 grant funds, we anticipate being able to expand our current two day a week morning instruction to four. All of our classes are currently at capacity and we often receive inquiries from individuals wanting to enroll. We will provide 864 hours of paid ESL instruction and 144 of volunteer ESL instruction as well as enroll 75 students in our daytime classes. The proposed project seeks to increase our morning classes to four days a week by paying for ESL instructors, increasing the hours of our Workforce Development Director, providing childcare, and fund printing, books & supplies.      Centro will be using the internationally recognized Cambridge Ventures ESL Curriculum. This curriculum anticipates that a student who regularly attends classes will be able to achieve 80% or more on assessments. Students who attain this percentage or better are considered proficient in the material and permitted to move on to the subsequent level. Centro expects to have at least 90 advancements. ","The proposed program has been designed to expand the current Adult ESL classes to meet the demand from the growing Latino community. Many individuals are unable to attend the more frequent and intensive evening courses offered at Centro Hispano due to employment barriers. By expanding the frequency of enrollment and availability of the morning course, we will be able to increase the number of individuals served as well as quality of instruction offered. 	Additionally, a crucial component of the project design is the curriculum. The Ventures series covers the four main elements of language acquisition: listening comprehension, writing, reading comprehension, and speaking. Each of these is an integral part of the program's purpose which seeks to provide Latinos with the tools necessary to become self-reliant in their communication. Furthermore, by creating a structured learning environment and monitoring student satisfaction we will be able to increase our retention rate.","The morning ESL Program is designed to start in August of 2019 along with the beginning of public schools in Knox County. This paralleled scheduling permits attendance from stay at home parents as well as 2nd and 3rd shift workers. Three 2-hour classes will be taught four times a week for 36 weeks by three instructors. Additionally, one of the instructors paid by the Dollar General grant will donate 4 hours per week of advanced English pronunciation and conversation classes to students attending the daytime courses. ","Centro's ESL programs use the Ventures Series from Cambridge. In accordance to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity ACT of 2014, this six-level curriculum is aligned with the National Reporting System (NRS), English Language Proficiency (ELP), and College and Career Readiness (CCR) standards. This series incorporates the skills necessary for successful entry into either the college or career path and equips students to effectively communicate in their day-to-day lives. The ESL program at Centro Hispano utilizes various methods to track the progress of our students. Each new student is given a diagnostic exam as well as an oral interview by the program director to assess their capacity with the English language. Once a student is placed in the program, their progress is monitored by 10 chapter exams as well as a Midterm and Final. Students who score above an 80 on the exams are considered proficient in the course material and are permitted to move to the next level. Additionally, quarterly surveys are given to the students in order to determine their satisfaction with the program.","Centro Hispano is housed in a 3,000 square foot facility granted in-kind by Knox County. This building contains dedicated classroom spaces for our various levels of Adult ESL instruction and two classrooms and a library dedicated to the youth program.","Each of the student textbooks used in the Ventures series is equipped with QR codes. These codes can be scanned with a student's smartphone or tablet and link to additional online educational videos, audios, and exercises. If the student does not have access to this technology, a CD can be provided with the audio necessary to complete auditory comprehension modules. Additionally, CDs and CD players are utilized by the instructors to administer exams.",No,,"$68,000.00 ","$67,750.00 ","Centro Hispano is requesting $15,000 from Dollar General in order to facilitate the expansion of our morning ESL program. In order to successfully achieve this, $12,500 is requested for salaries for the additional days of instruction. $7,000 is requested to support the salaries of 3 qualified ESL instructors ($20 x 3 x 8hr x 36wk = $17,280). $4,000 is requested to provide childcare during the morning classes and $1,500 to support the Workforce Development (Adult ESL) Director's salary whose duties include student recruitment, program assessment, and staff oversight. $750 is requested in order to purchase additional instructor books and teaching materials. $1,000 is requested for printing and publications which include copies and advertisements to promote the program. $500 is requested to purchase classroom materials such as pencils, paper, and workbooks.

We will provide pre-GED, and intensive math and writing remediation focused on moving these students into the GED Lab program. Our expected outcomes include: 5 students advancing in/through their pre-GED level into eligibility for entrance into the GED Lab, and 10 students passing all or part of the GED exam.","The Adult Literacy League (ALL), in our 51st year of service to Central Florida, is entering a new chapter. Our long-serving (25 years) executive director, Joyce Whidden, retired at the end of 2018. We are seeking Dollar General Literacy Foundation's support to usher us into a new era of service, helping Central Floridians to prepare for and earn their GEDs. We respectfully request $15,000 to provide instructional and support services to a minimum of 45 adult learners. These are adults who have expressed passing the GED as an objective. We will purpose both pair and well-trained volunteer instructional staff using best practices for instruction and assessments in concert with individualized support services. Our efforts will be directed towards assisting these learners to prepare for and pass all or part of the GED OR advance and increase skills sufficiently to begin actual GED preparation. Our objectives are to: 1. recruit, enroll and assess 45 adult students with GED aspirations who are at levels measured by GAIN and BEST Literacy tests. 2. provide a minimum of 3 GED Labs and a maximum of 4 during the grant year so that a minimum of 10 students will work towards passing all or part of the GED exam. 3. Provide pre-GED instruction in both class & one-to-one tutoring session to move a minimum of 5 students up to the 8.0 grade level requirement for participating in the GED Lab. 4. support students and instructors as required. 5. Remove barriers to GED success.","Admission to ALL's GED Lab will be based on students' test scores on the GAIN (Wonderlic) and BEST Literacy assessment tools. Students must achieve a minimum grade level equivalent of 8.0 for immediate acceptance to the GED Lab. The Adult Literacy League will offer a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 iterations of the 12-week GED Lab during the grant year.  Each GED Lab will feature 6 hours of instructional contact per week - 2 hours each of math, language arts, social studies and science (each of the GED Exam subject areas). For those students wishing to enter the GED Lab, but whose test scores are insufficient for immediate enrollment, classes and/or one-to-one tutoring in math and language arts will be provided to aid them in bringing their skills up to the requisite levels. These students will be offered a minimum of 2 hours per week in math and language arts subject areas, with a maximum target of 6 hours per week. Students will be post-tested after the required number of hours as mandated by the test publisher (for example, after 40-hours for the GAIN test) and will be admitted to the lab upon reaching the target level.","This project is based on a one-year timeline beginning June 1, 2019. It will be our commitment to offer at least 3 GED Labs of 12-weeks in duration. It is possible to have 4 GED Labs between June 1, 2019 and May 30, 2020. This would total 48 weeks of GED Lab class. We have, once again, cautiously provided a minimum of three, but feel that four is not impossible with this project as it includes the pipeline of students bring prepared for the Lab. Weekly GED Lab instruction is 12 hours. The pre-GED students will receive on-going instruction in an open-enrollment setting. Math classes will be held every Tuesday and Thursday and are ""drop-in"" sessions open from 9:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. on both days. We offer ABE classes, also open-enrollment, on Thursdays from 11 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. We offer intensive remedial writing classes on Saturday mornings, as well as Advanced Vocabulary classes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Maximum pre-GED instructional time is 16.5 hours per week. Tutors will be trained and provided during this time frame for all students who request one. Average weekly instructional time will be 2 hours per week with a tutor. Dual enrollment - classes and tutoring - will be recommended and encouraged so the potential for increased hours is always present. ","All students entering the Adult Literacy League's program will receive an assessment appropriate to their situation. The BEST Literacy test is administered to incoming ESL students, and they are post-tested after the requisite number of instructional hours (between 30 and 80 hours, depending on the intensity of service). GAIN (by Wonderlic) is the assessment provided for ABE students and we follow the required testing rubric for this instrument as well (post-test eligibility after 40 hours of instruction). These instruments establish the student's skills and functioning level. When sufficient hours of instruction are documented, they will be assessed using one of the tools outlined above. In addition, we will use Pearson's ""GED Ready!""  test. Each of these tools offer feedback for the students and instructors regarding areas of weakness and strength.  The computer-based tools we use correlate with the workbooks and texts used. This is critical since the GED test is completely online - paper tests no longer exist. Instructors provide portfolio assessments of their students' progress as well.

Lodi residents face the isolation of rural poverty, lacking access to nearby social services, public transportation and adult education. Lodi has no local offices of government job assistance, so Ohio Means Jobs workers visit the Lodi Family Center (LFC) once a week to provide assistance in Lodi. LFC is where our services are offered as well.","The four-year graduation statistics indicate that 12.2% of Lodi area residents drop out of high school (Ohio Board of Ed Report Card, Cloverleaf SD). Of concern, too, are the U.S. Census statistics indicating that 17% of the population does not hold a high school diploma. There are no other adult education programs providing GED/literacy  tutoring in Lodi; students would have to find transportation to travel over 11 miles to the local career center.","According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 20.3% of residents in Lodi live in poverty, and over 34% of families with children under 18 years of age are living in poverty. Lodi statistics reveal that 30% of all families in this area are living below the federal poverty line. When we look at households lead by females with children, 32% of these households are below the poverty line.","The state of Ohio does not collect literacy statistics by community; however, when we review Lodi's regionally high poverty rate (20.3%), relatively high drop-out rate (12.2%) and high percentage of adults over 25 without a high school diploma (17%), we can conclude that there is a higher illiteracy rate in this part of our county and a high need for literacy and skills tutoring.",,"Partnering with the Lodi Family Center, Project: LEARN offers literacy tutoring services to families in Southwest Medina County. We will continue to provide literacy tutoring, skills training and GED/HSE instruction on site in Lodi in 2019 and beyond. We will increase our student load, from 15 to 20 in the coming year, and continue to offer services to Lodi-area families in specializations like ASVAB preparation, skills refreshers for employment advancement, and other adult learning needs.","Our goals to extend services in the Lodi area:1. We want to retain our current availability level of service in Lodi, such that students can have easy access to assistance in their local community. With Dollar General support, services are available two days a week, and this level of service seems to be appropriate for the population we are assisting.2. We want to focus more attention on transitional skills tutoring, which helps low-skilled workers transition into higher-skilled and higher-paid positions. Our work with Workforce Development has shown a need for skills refreshers for underemployed individuals in this area of the county. While such individuals already have diplomas or GEDs, their skills have languished and need to be refreshed. Workforce has connected us to employers in the area who are in need of these types of services. We would be extending our services to offer this new type of tutoring in the new year--and have already begun working with some students who require transitional skills tutoring. We are seeing good results (students who are getting better jobs and moving up at current employers).3. We will always offer GED/HSE assistance and ESL assistance by request at any time to any adult who asks.4. Overall, we hope to increase service offerings to over 20 individuals in the program year.5. We will also continue to make  5 annual new presentations/ connections to local businesses and organizations who may know of students who need our services.","Project: LEARN will continue to use our long-time program components to serve Lodi, as well as offering new programs in the new year:1. Community outreach: We will increase local community members' awareness of our presence in Lodi. We will continue presentations to community groups, posters, newspaper advertising, word of mouth, and appearances as job fairs and expos to get the word out throughout the area. We made 6 additional presentations in 2018-19; we will make at least 5 additional presentations in the new year.2. We have a highly skilled and experienced tutor supervisor assigned to Lodi. Continuing his presence at the rate of two days per week will enable him to continue to see students, train tutors, supervise volunteer tutors and see drop-in clients. His presence on site is crucial to our program.3. We will provide our well-established program of free, one-on-one tutoring to any adult in the Lodi area who requests our help. All materials will be provided to the student free of charge.4. We will add a focus on transitional skills training, including refreshing basic and applied math skills, reading comprehension, and overall literacy to our program. Local conditions call for a focus in this area, as GED/HSE recruitment is difficult in this insular community, and Workforce Development has encouraged us to focus our efforts in this newer realm of skill enhancement.We will provide our time-tested curriculum to all students who ask for services, free of charge.","Our intent is to maintain a permanent presence in Lodi for all of our adult literacy programs. Students may take anywhere from 90 days to 2 years to pass the HSE; we put no timelines on student success. As long as the student wishes our help, we will support their learning. Our current average is about one year in the HSE program.Students learning English (uncommon in Lodi) are able to continue to meet with a tutor as long as they wish; typical program length is 6 months to one year.We find that transitional skills development often leads to support for additional training for students (an example: a student was promoted at work due to increased skill development, and was given the opportunity for further training via online courses. He had no internet access at home, so he continued his skill development at our Lodi site). Our goal is to be a resource for continuous skill development for long-term and short-term student needs. All students in our programs receive 60-90 minutes of direct instruction per week, but some use our facilities for self-directed instruction (such as work skills webinars or online courses) in addition to their direct instruction. We provide access to technology and network services to make this possible. Our program's flexibility means a student could use our services off and on as needed throughout the year. It is important to note that students can begin our program at any time, 12 months of the year, and can leave and return as needed.","At Project: LEARN, we do not believe in testing our students frequently. Our focus is on creating a supportive, flexible and encouraging environment in which to learn and achieve goals. At intake, we use the TABE test to assess student ability levels and design the initial curriculum for students. For the low literacy students, we use a WRT, Word Reading Test, that assesses word recognition (this is much less intimidating than the TABE for low literacy students). We also use the Reading Horizons program to assess progress as the student moves from letter identification to pre-reading skills to increasing reading fluency. Reading Horizons provides a tested, accurate assessment of student progress that can be tracked with reliability and validity.GED students use the most current edition of Kaplan's ""New GED Test: Strategies, Practice and Review"" workbooks. We use their pretests and end of section tests to assess student progress throughout the curriculum. Completion of a section of the program is defined as achieving a greater than 75% on the post test for that section. We use the Reading Horizons program, as well as an internal tool, to assess ESL skill improvement as a student moves through our program. Reading Horizons provides ongoing assessment throughout the program","At Project: LEARN, we have over 36 years of experience in providing GED, ESL and low literacy tutoring to adults,. We are fortunate to have a partnership with the Lodi Family Center to provide us with the physical space necessary to deliver services. Last year's DG grant provided us with important supplies necessary to run our program, which remain in service in the new program year. Additional supplies, especially consumables such as workbooks, calculators, and study books, will need to be purchased in order to continue serving students in Lodi. We have relationships with publishers and providers for all of the required materials.","HP and Lenovo laptops are used on a  daily basis with students to access web based curricula as well as software installed on the laptops. Laptops are available on a 1:1 basis for students and staff. Fast, multi-user WiFi and broadband is available and used daily. Laptops currently in use are 2 years old on average. A laser printer is available for use. USB storage drives are provided as needed.

Our tutoring is free and and our services will expand with the number of volunteers available. Our tutoring is provided in the comfort of refugee womens' homes, which is important because the women in our community suffer particular constraints. Our curriculum addresses the urgent language needs of women in the community today, applying English to empower them to go forward in building their lives in the United States. The program initially focuses on delivering English language basics, prenatal and maternal education, and driving permit lessons. We are partnered with three local universities: University of New Haven, Wesleyan University and Yale University. Through these partnerships we are able to maintain a constant stream of dedicated volunteers.","Elenas Light is a year long program. Because our volunteers are university students, our timeline is based on semesters. We begin matching volunteers with program participants in the early spring semester. One on one tutoring begins in the spring,continues through the summer and is completed within the fall. There are three scheduled assessments a semester to track program participant progress.  Weekly instruction varies from woman to woman, however we ensure that each woman will have at least 2 hours of instructional time per week. ","Progress monitoring will be our main method of measuring program participant progress. We will be measuring based on criterion-referenced assessments.We have chosen this method because volunteers will be able to efficiently administer  these assessments. Data will  be displayed to show the ""absolute discrepancy"" between where the student is performing relative to the expected target or level. The data can be graphed to measure a change in rate of progress relative to expected growth over time.","To establish Elenas Light as a non profit, we are working towards finding an office space out of which Elenas Light can be based.

Staff must undergo rigorous evaluation and receive structured feedback to improve their performance.  This evaluation should cover the staff's understanding and grasp of professional practice and include measures of student learning.","The Excel Center will operate a balanced school calendar, with five eight-week terms in each academic year. Credits can be earned each term and students and teachers will work diligently to condense a semester's worth of material into each term. This schedule will allow students to earn credits quickly and make rapid progress towards their diploma. The Excel Center's curriculum integrates material across disciplines so that one course combines academic standards across multiple subjects, allowing students to earn credit in multiple areas while attending one class. The school will be open to students in the morning, afternoon, and/or evening, based on student need and demand.The self-paced nature of the program serves both those with learning disabilities or limited English proficiency who may need to take one class at a time and those who are gifted and want to accelerate through the program in the least amount of time possible. The relevance of a high school education that leads to valuable career and dual-credit options for postsecondary education increases the chance for employment success for anyone regardless of skill level or ability. The Excel Center maintains high expectations for all of its students in order to adequately prepare them for successful careers after graduation or transitions into postsecondary education.","Goodwill will be incorporating the ACCUPLACER, a national assessment used to assess college readiness in English and math into our assessment process. We will administer this test to our students in either English 5 or 6 and Algebra II or CCR Math to measure their skill level and then provide them with any remediation necessary to make sure they are successful in post-secondary education. Their scores on the ACCUPLACER will also be used to determine if they are able to participate in a dual credit course (a class in which they receive both high school and college credit) before they graduate. We will also utilize Mastery Trackers, spreadsheets created by the classroom teachers to monitor student performance on classroom assessments. These documents help teachers identify students that are struggling with mastering certain standards and provide immediate, differentiated instruction to those students to make sure they are meeting the course expectations. Data is updated frequently and is shared among teaching staff as they coach each other on how to help individual students. The trackers also help the teacher determine which students are able to move on to the next course in the sequence and ensure that all students are mastering the content of their course.

In order to obtain the project goal of 20 students to advance 2 levels in the ABE program, 25 students will be enrolleed in those classes. For 15 students to become  proficient in English 20 students will be enrolled in the ESL program.  In order for 10 students to receive their GED diplomas, 15 students will be enrolled in the GED program. ","Project Learn uses several methods to achieve its goals and measure its successes.  Once a student is enrolled, a test is given for Adult Basic Education (T.A.B.E.) is given to the enrollee to create a baseline metric to measure progress.  Leveraging the prowess of the T.A.B.E. helps personalize each persons learning course through the development of ILPS(Individualized Learning Prescriptions) and offers measurable tracking rubrics through periodic re-tests. Once mastery of subject matter is supported, learners move to track-able pre-GED tests.  Proficiency of these tests indicates a student's readiness for the GED exam.  Classes include tests, computer simulations, computerized testing, traditional testing and a variety of regular classroom instructions.  Project Learn owns the Steck-Vaugh READ ON! accelerated reading software and has installed the software at sites on laptops and its computer labs to make the source available to the local residents enrolled at those sites.  It is considered an invaluable resource to those learners unable to read at a proficient level to gain GED certification.  Students can access software outside of regular class time to further increase their learning curve and help them meet the milestone inherent to Project Learn's curriculum.","It is anticipated that all classes at both sites will be opened on the first Monday in June (June 3, 2019).  Project Learn tests students leveraging the evidence based outcomes of the Test for Adult Basic Education (T.A.B.E.) at entrance to establish a baseline and quarterly thereafter to measure progress, identify deficiencies and tract readiness for GED testing. In terms of general program success, Project Learn will help learners to master subject matter to the point they are proficient to advance to the official GED exam.  GED classes are held twice a week for a duration of two (2) instructional hours.  ESL classes are held once a week- duration 2 instructional hours. A.B.E. classes are held once a week - duration 2 instructional hours.  Regular attendance prepares students to test for the GED within a 12 month period.  Additional tests are given at the completion of subject matter to measure percentage of mastery.  Short term measures: Initial TABE testing of new students and the development of ILP's within 1 month of enrollment.Immediate measures: Retest learners quarterly to tract progress and identify strengths and deficiencies.Long term measures: Prepare students to take the official GED exam within 12 months of study. ","Learners are tracked using TABE testing protocols to determine educational/proficiency level(s).  Subsequent testing measures the learner's progress by comparing baseline scores against subsequent scores.  These analyses show each learner's progress towards the mastery of subject matter required to pass the GED exam.  As students show proficiency, the difficulty of tests progress to the point the learner is considered ready to take the pre-GED test.  Once proficiency on the pre-GED exam is demonstrated, learners are prepared to take the GED exam.  Ultimate success results in the attainment of the GED diploma.  Instructor assessment plays a significant role when successive testing occurs,  Instructors also offer individualized tutoring sessions when analysis warrants extra help.

The average adult learner enters Next Door's Adult Basic Education program with a 5th grade equivalency reading level.",,"Next Door's Adult Education Program serves approximately 150 students per year in Milwaukee's most impoverished areas. We provide customized academic instruction to prepare students for high school completion, post-secondary education, and help to improve their employability.  Through a rigorous course of study, each student will demonstrate academic gains leading them to a high school completion or improved employability skills, and greater self-sufficiency.","Low income students will improve employability skills and make academic gains that prepare them for high school completion. Eighty students will demonstrate gains of at least one year grade equivalency in math, reading, or language arts after 16 weeks of instruction.  Ninety-five students will make progress on their academic goals after 12 hours or more of instruction.  Ninety-five students will report having more confidence in academic ability after 12 hours or more of instruction. Research demonstrates that self-confidence -- not an inventory of skills or one's social behavior -- is the best predictor of success.All students in Next Door's Adult Basic Education program will receive a minimum of 16 hours of financial literacy and 16 hours of digital literacy training.  Furthermore, students will receive a 16-week Next Door Work Readiness Certificate, preparing them to gain and maintain employment and helping them achieve greater economic self-sufficiency.  Sixty students will earn certificates in digital literacy work readiness, and financial literacy.In 2017-18, we expanded the Adult Basic Education program by adding the Next Door Early Childhood Scholars.  This program is a new career pathway customized for un/underemployed parents of children enrolled in programs at Next Door. The outcomes are for 48 participants to complete the program, earn a CDA, and be employed by Next Door or a partner site.","Next Door prepares adult learners for high school completion and helps improve students' employability. Students range in ages of 18 to 66 years old and span academic abilities of 1st to 12th grade levels. The average student enters our program at a 5th grade reading level.  We provide individualized and small group instruction, combining interactive software, traditional lecture, and small group lesson activities. Students' academic programs are supplemented with financial literacy, job readiness, and digital literacy instruction.  Instructors place students in one of three academic tracks based on intake exams. Students at a high school level enter the Fast Track General Education Development (GED) Program, which prepares them for four state GED exams.  A secondary track (5.09 Preparation Program) is a 16-week program, preparing students for a High School Equivalency Diploma. A third track is for students testing at or below a 5th grade level. They enter the Basic Skills Program, learning introductory concepts in math, reading, and language to increase their academic proficiency and vocational skills, then are prepared to for the GED Program. Low-income students enrolled in our Early Childhood Scholars program complete three child development courses and an in-classroom practicum. Upon successful completion, participants earn a Childhood Development Associate credential, and are positioned as priority candidates for positions at Next Door or a partner site.","Next Door provides a year-round program with nine hours of weekly instruction and three hours of study time. Students participate Monday thru Thursday, in either a morning session (9 a.m. to noon), or the afternoon session (1 p.m. to 4 p.m.). Thursdays are often used to make up any missed times during the week. The length of the program is determined by students' academic level on entry, attendance, and motivation.  Next Door hosts weekly orientation sessions in response to our students' needs for a more flexible enrollment period. Upon enrollment, students' academic levels are assessed.  Results are tabulated for students who enrolled during an academic school year and participated in at least 144 hours of classroom instruction.  After at least 12 hours of instruction, students complete a confidential online survey to determine their progress on their academic goals and their confidence in academic abilities. As for the Early Childhood Scholars, one cohort of 18 students is scheduled to complete coursework by  May 2019, and the final cohort of 44 students is scheduled to complete their coursework by August 2019. ","All students will utilize the computer-based TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education), which measures skills in Reading, Mathematics, and Language Skills. The tests are timed and take approximately four hours to complete.In partnership with United Way, we use the IC-Results Measurement and Analysis Tool to administer a confidential, online 25-question survey.  The survey is tabulated when submitted and maintained throughout the academic year.Next Door staff tracks participant demographics, program attendance, and assessment data. Demographic data includes: gender, date of birth, age, ethnicity, highest grade completed, employment status at entry and exit (self-reported), parental status, annual income and income source.Program participation is collected through daily attendance. Students are expected to attend all nine hours of classes per week.  Next Door's Early Childhood Scholar's assessments are industry-recognized and provided by an accredited training partner, Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC). Participants must earn a passing grade of a ""C"" grade or higher on assessments administered by instructors.

Each apprentice will receive 480 to 960 hours of intensive classroom instruction in their tech occupation at no cost to them prior to beginning 12 months of paid on-the-job training.  At the completion of their program they will have several industry certifications, experience, and a journeyman's card that will allow them to compete successfully for open tech positions.","Goal 1: Identify, vet and pair tech apprentices with hiring partners in one of three tech occupations (Systems Administration, Network Security, Software Developer) *	Place 85 vetted candidates in technology apprenticeship with local employers in 2019*	Market the Apprenti TN program to underemployed and targeted minority groups through partnerships with local community organizations and military support organizations*	Survey candidates at beginning of program, end of training, at 2, 5, and 10 months on the job, and at the conclusion of the apprenticeship to identify and create support systems for apprentices to help ensure their success.Goal 2: Through vetted training partners, successfully prepare 85 apprentices for a twelve-month apprenticeship with a hiring partner in Middle Tennessee, covering the cost of training and support for the apprentice.*	Identify and vet additional training partners for each of the three occupations*	Begin discussions with hiring partners about taking on training costs. *	Raise additional funds necessary to ensure that training and support costs for 85 apprentices are covered.Goal 3:  Among the 85 apprentices maintain or exceed the current diversity percentages among targeted groups as follows:	Women		24%	Veterans	50%	Minorities	43%*	Work with community agencies to reach and engage potential Apprenti TN candidates*	Work with candidates to ensure they have the support systems in place to be successful","As a registered apprenticeship program, Apprenti TN is required by law to meet the parameters established by the National Apprenticeship Act to protect the welfare of the apprentice.  Apprenti TN will act as the Apprenticeship Intermediary - managing the apprentice employment process, maintaining documentation and fulfilling statutory reporting requirements for all apprentices registered in the Apprenti program.  Hiring partners affiliated with Apprenti TN must commit to the approved Standards of Apprenticeship.The initial education program will be conducted by training partners who agree:*	To develop curriculum that meets or exceeds the professional competencies established by any applicable testing or certification providers and meet or exceed the content coverage of vendor-specific reference courses (e.g., Microsoft Official Academic Course standards, Cisco, CompTIA, etc. competencies) and that all instructors are qualified and experienced in the subject matter undertaken by Apprenti students;*	To provide adequate physical facilities, computing hardware, and software licensing to accomplish the learning outcomes of the training programs; and *	To honor the minimum hours and content coverage required to satisfy completion of the training program as agreed, and supply NTCF with all required progress, attendance, academic performance (including grades), and exam results data related to Apprenti students upon request.","Anyone 18 years or older who can work in the US and has a high school equivalency can take the free on-line Apprenti assessment. Those interested in an apprenticeship in Nashville must score at least 80% in order to be considered for moving forward.  Apprenti TN staff conduct rigorous interviews to determine the candidate's occupation objective, fitness for the rigor of the program, and cultural fit for particular employers. Successful candidates will be sent to interviews with potential hiring partners, who will make the final selection.  A contract between the apprentice and hiring partner is signed.  Apprentices then begin a full-time educational program to build foundational knowledge and skills.  Depending upon the occupation, training lasts 480 to 960 hours.  Nationally recognized industry certifications exams verify progress and knowledge. (The content and number of exams vary with the different occupations.) Once the education/certification phase is completed successfully, the apprentice will begin full time on-the-job training for 50 weeks (2,008 hours).  On-the-job training requires the assignment of a mentor who is available to the apprentice at least 75% of the time.  Additional certifications may be pursued and obtained depending on the occupation area. ","The best evidence of the success of this program for each apprentice is the successful completion of the apprenticeship and retention by the hiring partner in a full-time tech position.  There will be milestones throughout the fifteen to eighteen-month process that will indicate future success:*	Successful and timely completion of the initial education program*	Passing of all required certification exams *	Successful onboarding into the company offering the apprenticeship*	Positive performance reviews from the employer*	Awarding of a ten percent raise after six months in recognition of improved proficiencyAdditionally, surveys will be administered at the beginning of program, end of training, at 2, 5, and 10 months on the job, and at the conclusion of the apprenticeship to identify and create support systems for apprentices to help ensure their success.","Project facilities are recently renovated (within 36 months) and accessible.

Dollar General's investment will be used to cover the training and support costs to move individuals into that tech job. Once Apprenti TN is a proven, successful source of new tech workers, responsibility for the training and support costs will be transitioned over to the hiring employers.  Apprenti TN quickly recognized that most candidates do not have the savings, resources or family support to go for three to six months without a paycheck during the intensive training program.  In order to reach the underemployed from diverse backgrounds, the NTCF is seeking funds to provide small living stipends for those candidates in need.

Only 87% of the county's population has a high school credential. ,,"GLA is serving roughly 1,000 students in the 2018-2019 fiscal year. Our students face  barriers that prevent them from being able to attend classes regularly. Some of these include: lack of transportation, lack of food security, and inability to take time away from work or caring for family at home. GLA sees this need firsthand, and funding from DGLF would allow us to expand our distance learning offerings to accommodate those who wish to learn but are up against the aforementioned barriers. ","The objective of this project is to ensure that any student who wants to succeed has every opportunity to do so despite the barriers that poverty can present. Our students currently use Aztec as the only means of structured study outside of GLA's walls. However, they're limited by the number of concurrent logins. While Aztec is a great tool that we will hopefully continue to renew and use to its full advantage, we would like to add a more GED-centric study tool for students who can't be with us in the classroom. GED Live, a Kaplan property, provides a comprehensive GED guide and study tool in the form of an online course. For the few students who have been able to afford this program independently and of their own accord, we have seen great results. Additionally, we serve over 500 people each year in the English as a Second Language part of our programming. Those students would benefit greatly from the ability to supplement their studies at home with Rosetta Stone courses and study guides. This at-home option also allows us to credit the students with more hours, resulting in better reviews from our federal committees. These opportunities will serve our entire population of over 1,000 students and will help us make our goal of 250 educational gains and 40 GEDs.Finally, for our program managers to most effectively utilize and continue to grow these resources, we would like to provide two of them with training at the ISTE Conference in 2019 in Philadelphia. ","GLA uses Aztec and Rosetta Stone to allow our students to approach learning from various angles. The Center for American Progress reports that ""Online learning can enable learning to happen in a variety of contexts, locations, and times; it allows for a transformation of curriculum and learning."" Greenville Literacy Association's goal is to be highly accessible to all of our students. We don't currently have access to GED Live, however we have seen independently how this program bolsters classroom learning and feel that it would be of great benefit to our students who can't make it into the building for a variety of reasons. These three programs, in combination with regular meetings with our program managers and pre- and post-testing, will allow us to provide a more comprehensive and effective educational foundation for our students to build upon. Funding from DGLF will allow us to purchase Rosetta Stone and GED Live seats for our students and will also allow us to renew our Aztec subscription. There is no substitute for the training experience that a conference such as ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) provides. Our program managers benefit greatly from the resources and hands-on practical applications that they receive at this conference. To give them the resources stated above in conjunction with the training of the ISTE conference would ultimately bring our students the best-case scenario of a trained expert with multiple outlets for learning. ","This project will be implemented upon the receipt of funding and will last for one year (expected timeline for use of Rosetta Stone and GED Live seats, actual timeline for Aztec subscription). The perceived dates at this time are April 2019-April 2020. Student hours are unlimited within our business hours, which are M-F 9-4. During those times, students have full access to our centers and to our program director and managers by phone or email. ","In addition to the aforementioned pre- and post-testing, we use multiple tests to confirm results and report those to the necessary outlets. Some of these include BEST, BEST +, BEST Literacy, and GED pre-tests. These are given at different times and allow us to monitor student success, while as a bonus allowing students to work on their test-taking skills. ","One helpful and unique aspect of a distance learning program is that we don't have to rely on our own computer systems to conduct the courses and study guides. The DL program is designed to give our students the freedom to own their education. However, they are allowed and encouraged to use our facilities for studying and computer lab hours at their discretion and need. Due to a recent grant that allowed us to upgrade the headphones in our lab (Rosetta Stone uses headphones), we are currently well-equipped with hardware. ","We have three computer labs, one at each of our learning centers, that are equipped with internet and the necessary software for the three programs in this request. They are also all newly equipped with headphones that were recently upgraded with grant funding. The average age of computers in our labs is 8-10 years. ",Yes,"We will use the software either in tandem with our classroom settings, or for those students who are not able for whatever reason to make it into our centers, we will use it in that case to allow them to complete self-led time-limited courses at home (meaning that Rosetta Stone and GED Live are only available for 90-day sessions each).

Graduation rate varies among the six high schools but the average is about 85%. The ELL classes at CFPIN serve the refugee and immigrant community in Lincoln. Two years ago we were serving about 600 students per year with no-cost classes and due to the current political climate, our classes are much smaller. We are committed to providing this service because many refugees continue to resettle in Lincoln from other places.","A community report generated every two years by the University of Nebraska shows the poverty rate among New Populations in Lincoln at 36%. This is more than double the rate of the general adult population which is at 16%. Refugees and immigrants still struggle with finding employment and becoming self sufficient if they do not have adequate English skills. Many employers in Lincoln have found refugees to be excellent employees and seek them out, but English skills must come first.","Lincoln, NE is a highly educated community and overall, the state's literacy rate is estimated at 94%. The refugee population we serve has a wide range of educational experience from their home countries. Some are barely literate in their native language and others have achieved great academic success.

The participants in LaAmistad programs predominantly work in service and manual labor industries and are low-income earners.  ,"The most recent data available reports that Atlanta's high school graduation rate was 77% for the 2016-2017 academic school year. Yet, Hispanic students were twice as likely to drop out from high school than their non-minority counterparts. With the Hispanic community accounting for almost 25% of the student population nationwide and continuing to rise, the services that LaAmistad provides are critical to helping the Latino student and other English language learners.","The rate of people who are living under the poverty level in Atlanta is around 25%, with the numbers in the suburbs growing at a faster rate. Most of LaAmistad participants fall under this demographic.  ","According to a review of 2010 census data, 28% of adults in Atlanta are functionally illiterate. Nationwide reading proficiency rates are 25 % lower among minority students than their white counterparts. Locally, this literacy gap in Atlanta has been growing.  ",,"LaAmistad ESL classes are held in six locations in the Metro Atlanta area serving 483 students last year. Four 10-week sessions are offered during the calendar year with students receiving 30 hours of English instruction (3 hours/week). Six levels of classes are offered and students are placed in the class that matches their level of English proficiency. The program's adopted standard for success is a final grade of at least 70%, a measure that indicates significant mastery of the coursework.  ","The objective of ESL is to teach English language learners according to the needs and skill level of each individual student and for them to master English language communication skills. Recognizing that the need is constantly growing among Atlanta's immigrant population, we plan to expand the reach of LaAmistad's ESL programming by increasing our total site coverage and enrolling 500 students by the end of fiscal year 2019. Of these 500 students, we expect 80% (~400) to receive a passing grade and move on to the next level of our program at each semester's end. In order to ensure consistency and improve on quality of instruction, we will provide an introductory internal training seminar for new teachers and ongoing support through professional training workshops. Through these efforts we expect 90% (~23) of our volunteers to return to continue teaching for our programming for the duration of at least 2 semesters.Lastly, to guarantee the quality of our program we will implement measures that assess the effectiveness of our instructors, the quality of instructional materials, level of support and usefulness of training workshops given to volunteers based on feedback we receive from teachers and students alike. This evaluation will take place in the form of a survey administered during the last class for each session, all of which we hope to reach a 90% satisfaction rate with. ","To ensure our program is effective in helping immigrant adults reach their personal, academic and career goals, LaAmistad ESL's program is based on best practices in adult literacy and ESL instruction. LaAmistad ESL is designed to conform to Equipped for the Future (EFF) Standards for Adult Literacy and Lifelong Learning as established by the National Institute for Literacy. These standards concentrate on skills that adults need to succeed in their new culture including communication, decision-making, interpersonal skills and lifelong learning skills. An in-house placement test is given at the beginning of each session to determine the student's level of English proficiency. Their performance is tracked and compared at the end of each term when students must earn a 70% final class grade to demonstrate progress and move on to the next level of study. The final exams are administered at the end of each term, measuring the students' retention of material presented during each 10-week session. The tests cover grammar, listening, reading and writing. ESL student averages are above the minimum level, consistently tracking in the 80's.  ","LaAmistad's ESL program now offers 4 ten week sessions throughout the calendar year. During each session, students receive thirty hours of English instruction (three hours of instruction per week). Students can attend classes on a rotation of either Mon/ Wed, Tues/Thurs or on Saturday mornings. Six levels of classes are offered so that the needs of all learners can be met, and students are placed in the class that best matches their level of English proficiency. Each level requires two sessions to complete, thus if a student initiates at our introductory level and passes every session uninterrupted, they can be expected to fully complete our program within 3 years. In addition, LaAmistad has begun to offer conversation partners for many of its participants in an effort to enhance their speaking skills and enable them to engage in dialogue with a native English speaker more confidently.","The program's internally adopted standard for success is a final grade of 70%, a measure that indicates significant mastery of the coursework. Ultimately, the success of our volunteer program is reflected in the success of our students. By recruiting highly engaged volunteers, providing them with training in ESL teaching methods, giving them first-rate resources and ongoing guidance, our students are more likely to receive superior English instruction that produces positive results.At the end of each semester, teachers and students complete our program's evaluation survey that provides staff with feedback on all aspects of their experience in the program, including the usefulness of the teacher's lesson plans and other instructional materials and resources, the pace of the class, and the instructional methods. The evaluation results are compiled and shared with teachers. Program reconstruction is based on survey outcomes.To gain quantitative data on our students' progress, final exams are administered at the end of each semester. Once test scores are collected, program coordinators share results with teachers who use the data for student placement and identification of activities and lessons to aid in the improvement of skills taught. ","As LaAmistad continues to grow its programs, ESL is now held at six locations across Metro Atlanta; including Holy Innocents' Episcopal Church, Shallowford Presbyterian Church, Trinity Anglican Church, YELLS Community Action Cafe, Centro Catolico at Mission Village, and South Cobb Recreation Center. All classrooms are spacious and conducive for the adult learner. Equipment and supplies needed to support the instructional program are housed in the ESL offices at the locations. These materials, such as literacy games and educational media are utilized as supplements to enhance comprehension of lessons covered in the students' workbooks.  ","The program currently makes use of CDs for in- class instruction and take-home assignments to improve students' auditory comprehension.

Hunting Park, the neighborhood primarily served by the Esperanza English Institute, is predominantly low-income with a median household income of less than $23,000 and a 24 percent unemployment rate. The need for affordable English language opportunities in this community is crucial and support for EEI will improve Englishliteracy and employment opportunities for those seeking a better life in Philadelphia. EEI's goal is to prepare non-English speaking immigrants and LEP individuals in thePhiladelphia community to navigate daily life in the U.S. and to pursue their personal goals, including education and expanded employment opportunities by increasing English language proficiency. To this end, we expect the following accomplishments atthe end of the grant period: 1.) increase enrollment from 485 to 500 students 2.) increasethe term completion rate to 48% (232 students) 3.) improve retention rate to 33% with 160students attending more than one term 4.) increase the number of EEI students applyingand enrolling in Esperanza College, with 25% of Level 4 applying (4-5 students) and 10%of Level 4 enrolling (2-3 students).","Students will attend classes in their respective level (0-4) three times per week in the evenings over a 14-week term.

Yell County has an unemployment rate of 4.2% and Pope's is 4.5%, making both slightly higher than the national average of 4.0%. Employment, however, does not equal an end to poverty. Many jobs are part-time and low paying. Yell County has a poverty rate of 19% and in Pope the rate is 18%. The national average is only 12.3%. ","The Yell County high school graduation rate is 78.9%. The graduation rate in Pope is 84%. This is similar to national averages. Of equal or greater concern is the number of students who are graduating yet unable to read above a third grade level. This deficiency becomes visible when adults seek higher-paying jobs, try to help their children with homework, or when they can not read their hospital discharge instructions. In our communities, a high school diploma does not always equal literacy. ","The poverty rate in Yell County is 19%.  In Pope it's around 18%.  These percentages are even larger for our unincorporated rural communities. Per capita income in Yell County is 20,209.00 and in Pope County it is 21,650.00. The median income for families in both counties is around 40,000.00. The national median income, however, is around 61,000.00. Poverty, including generational poverty is a huge problem in our communities that crosses racial lines.","One in seven adults in Arkansas read below a fifth grade level.  This is especially concerning combined with data that tells us 72% of children whose parents have low literacy levels will also struggle. These cycles repeat and compound.  We also have a large immigrant population struggling to learn English. According to the Arkansas Department of Education, only 38% of students in Yell County schools are reading at grade level. These problems require inter-generational solutions and support. ",,"We recognize Pope and Yell County as our greatest areas for growth. We hired a new director and relocated. We will serve 210 people, laying the groundwork for hundreds more. Offerings include conversational group ESL classes, basic literacy and math one-on-one tutoring, and family literacy programs, partnering with the public schools and area libraries to help parents help their children. The programs we create in these counties will be replicated throughout our five county region. ","We have a wonderful partnership with our Adult Education office and will continue this partnership. But we know there are many people with literacy needs in our community that are not seeking a GED and will never walk through the doors.  Adults who speak English as their first language are ashamed to admit they need help and ESL learners may not want to draw attention to their families. We must build programs that go where the people are,tailoring services to our local needs and local resources. We have three main focus areas: Interactive, conversational ESL classes in partnership with the Spanish program at Arkansas Tech University, one-on-one basic math and literacy tutoring sessions in partnership with our regional Adult Education office, and family literacy programming in partnership with area libraries and public schools. For this program we will begin by targeting parents who are receptive to intergenerational after-school homework sessions.Our measurable outcomes are straightforward: We will increase our numbers to 210 students and once again become a viable resource in this community.  To build this community trust we will engage students as the co-creators of our programming, utilizing nation-wide resources as inspiration but creating our own local initiatives.  We will use our group classes to funnel students to our one-on-one and/or family sessions, laying the groundwork to triple our numbers over the coming three years. ","This programming is designed to bring increased and applicable services to Pope and Yell Counties and create programming we can eventually replicate in our entire five county service area. With this interactive programming we will reinvigorate our outreach services and bring stability, strategy, and focus to our organization. Our three main focus areas---Interactive, conversational ESL groups, one-on-one basic math and literacy tutoring, and after-school family literacy programming---will spread the word about our existence and our services, allowing us to get out into the community to meet families, increase our numbers, and to interactively develop programming that meets local needs.Families involved in family literacy will take part in a regular column in our local newspaper and on the KARV radio morning show, sharing their successes and spreading the word about our services. Adults engaged in our conversational ESL classes will provide weekly feedback on the topics they wished to see discussed and help us build up better programming for subsequent students. All students taking part in group sessions will be encouraged to sign up for one-on-one services and to consider someday becoming tutors themselves. One on-one services will also include job interview prep, resume help, and technology tutoring for job seeking adults.  ","Our three main focus areas--conversational ESL groups, one-on one literacy and math, and after school family literacy programs--are already in creation. One-on-one sessions average 20-30 weekly instructional hours. We can quickly bring these numbers up to 40-50 hours a week. These one-on-one services are targeted to the individual needs of each student/family and are not conducive to yearly timelines. Our first round of beginning conversational ESL classes are currently offered every Thursday night from 5:30-7:00. These are based on three month sessions, with the option for students to continue with one-on-one or family literacy programs after graduation and/or to take part in concurrent one-on-one sessions. Our first graduation for the conversational class will take place April 25th. Another class will begin in June. After our first graduation, graduates we will help us adjust and implement needed changes for the June class. This summer we will work in close partnership with the Pope County Library system, the Yell County Library system, our local bookstore Dog Ear books, and the area public schools, offering three, one hour a week family reading circles and hands-on activities at our area farmers markets,libraries, and community events. These programs will create incentives for families to take part in our one-on-one sessions and after-school sessions when school begins again in August.Our media programs will begin in June and feature families once a month.  ","Our core goal is to assist adults in meeting their self-appointed goals. We recognize that we serve adults who choose to take part in our services and therefore must be in charge of their own learning and an active participant in their assessment. To that end, our internal assessment for group classes begins with an intake interview and/or form wherein we ask students to tell us what they intend to gain from our services and ask them to rate their level of comfort with the skill set. We offer a list of skill set options including ""finding a better job,"" ""passing the Citizenship test,"" ""reading with my children,"" and ""engaging in everyday English speaking situations."" Students are also given the option to write in any additional or unlisted goals. Every 40 hours or so we revisit these intake forms and assess and discuss the improvements. We explore what's working and what isn't and adjust as needed. Students in the group ESL classes can take the ESLOA test at the beginning, middle and end of their four month session.  Students who choose to take part in one-on-one services and testing are given the TABE test every 60 hours to assess improvements and/or areas of concern. While we do believe that regular assessment is important, at this point in our outreach we recognize we must first create a welcoming atmosphere and engaging classes. We do not force TABE assessment on students who enter group classes. ","With the hiring of our new director in September of 2018, our office relocated to Dardanelle and is housed in the Parent/Educator Resource Center of the Dardanelle Public School System. Formerly the superintendent's office, this building is now home to the technology services, our Alliance office, and the school's curriculum director. A board room used for tutoring is located across the hall from our director's office. At the end of the hall is a room labeled""Parent/Educator Resource Center,"" which serves as a location for teacher development. We are working to revive the parent/educator resource center as a division of the Alliance, including using the excellent desks and projectors available. Our space is wonderful, but we are in great need of marketing and signage materials that reflect our name change, location, and services. We are in need of laptops and/or tablets so that students and tutors can access online ProLiteracy resources in our main offices and/or to be checked out for sessions at area libraries, coffee shops, or local businesses during lunch breaks. Our book selections are outdated and we are in need of new curriculum and resources that compliment our ESL classes, family literacy programming, and speak to the experiences of a diverse community. We have full access to our wonderful regional libraries as well as three area church community centers, the public school buildings, and an ongoing partnership with the Adult Education Centers. ","We have one desktop in Dardanelle that is used by our director and one desktop we can share with the ATU Adult Education office in Ozark. Both of these desktops have printers, and both of these computers are around five years old. We have six donated Intel 10.0 tablets, which can be used for streaming resources when internet is available. Through our partnerships with the Dardanelle School District, we have access to a large projector, which is used for our group classes. We have one laptop, but it is five years old and broken. We will be using recent private donations for new software. Having a laptop would allow our director to access documents and resources online while traveling. Having additional laptops would allow our tutors to hold sessions in places besides just our offices, including local businesses for before or after work classes, local coffee shops, churches, and community centers. ",Yes,"Our greatest need is laptop computers for our director, tutors and Americorps workers. Our director often travels throughout Pope and Yell counties and without a laptop this makes her work unnecessarily difficult. Because she is only part-time, being able to work efficiently is paramount. A workable laptop would allow her to access LACES( our documentation system) on the go. Likewise, laptops for our tutors and students would greatly increase our effectiveness in the expansion of Yell and Pope Counties. While not demographically sizable, taken together the two countries contain 1,780 square miles. To adequately serve these counties, and to meet people where they are, we need portable technology that will allow us to access Literacy Pro, ESLOA (English as a Second Language, Oral Assessment), the Bright Solutions Dyslexia Resources pages, Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, Khan Academy, and our own Google drives and webpage on the go.  ","$38,646.00 ","$38,646.00 ","With the hiring of our director this past September, we began rebranding ourselves to more adequately reflect what we offer our communities. The name change was essential both because we needed a fresh start and because it was discovered that we didn't have legal rights to the name River Valley Literacy Council. In short, we need funding for advertising.  Advertising needs include signage, printing, and outreach materials. A new logo was given in kind this past month. We are also in great need of technology and updated curriculum. We have no laptops and our current resource library is out of date, offers few ESL resources, and does not reflect the diversity of populations within our communities. We plan to order the updated Teaching Adults and Life Prints as well as the From Home to School series, an ESL resource through New Readers Press. Travel money is needed to assist our tutors in reaching out to rural communities, and professional development training could go a long way in helping us build up a long term sustainable strategy for our Alliance that would allow us to meet the diverse needs of our region.

","We want to create a program that improves literacy among older adults. We want to do this through Learning Upgrade, a digital learning platform. Our objective is two-fold. Improving older adults' literacy skills will improve other skills, such as health literacy and employment. And the digital platform will increase their digital literacy skills which will also improve their employment skills. All adults deserve proper literacy skills, including the often-marginalized older adult population. And we've all heard the reports that this population is growing (10,000 Americans a day turn 65) and living longer. This is rapidly becoming a societal problem as many older adults cannot afford to retire or support themselves on their Social Security check. Yet poor literacy skills (basic and digital), and factors such as ageism in the workplace, create barriers for older adults to achieve employment and economic self-sufficiency. As many essential resources and critical tasks continue to move online, it becomes increasingly important to prevent underserved groups lacking digital literacy from falling further behind economically and socially (Katherine Bates, et al, 2012). Data show that adult learners who receive computer skills training are employed at significantly higher rates than those who do not receive digital literacy training (Backman, 2015).","This project is a partnership between Community Tech Network (CTN) and Family Eldercare, two local non-profit organizations. The curriculum and timeline will be developed from the Learning Upgrade digital platform for adult learning.

Learning Upgrade's digital platform has 21 total courses from Kinder to Adult Ed, over 900 lessons with songs, video, and games and is available on the web, smartphones, and tablets. Family Eldercare will identify 12 older adult learners from the ten senior living communities that are part of their service coordination program. Family Eldercare employs service coordinators at these communities who know the residents and their needs. Family Eldercare will recruit those most in need, focusing on those with poor literacy skills and low incomes, to participate in the pilot. Each learner will receive a tablet with internet access and learn the basics on how to use the tablet or other device if applicable. Classes will be offered at the older adult's apartment community room for ease of access.","Funds will be used to implement the following activities per the following timeline.

Surveys will measure the effect that tablet/laptop training had on the participants' ability to access and use the Internet, understand the ways the Internet can make a difference in their lives to connect with others and access resources, and their interest in engaging in daily Internet use. Moreover, once new users learn to use a computer or tablet and understand how to safely and independently connect to the Internet, they then enhance their skills in a way that allows them to perpetually increase their ability to access sites and engage with the online community in a safe, secure, and sustainable manner.We will also employ Learning Upgrade's measurement tools, which offer several options including CASAS.

","OCCC offers free Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes in one sixteen week session per semester. Classes meet for 6 instructional hours per week, per class. Students can enroll in a maximum of 2 classes per week or 12 instructional hours per week. Upon completion of the programs, students have passed a practice exam and demonstrated preparedness to take the HiSET exam.Students who wish to apply for an exam fee voucher must meet one-on-one with a Career Navigator to participate in an Action Plan development session for career mapping. This session will provide a valuable additional touch-point with our students as they complete the program. The session will result in a plan for obtaining a job or enrolling in post-secondary education/training. Students who complete the session will be eligible to apply for the exam fee voucher for the HiSET. Students will also sign a release indicating they will report exam scores to OCCC for data tracking purposes.Vouchers will be purchased directly from the exam provider. Prior to receiving a voucher, a student must have completed a minimum of 40 instructional hours for HiSET testing. Documentation of taking a practice test with a likely to pass score or rating is required for students to qualify for a voucher. The success rate of students who receive vouchers will be carefully tracked. The impact of the addition of the Career Navigator sessions will also be assessed through tracking of student outcome data.

We will track student success at each stage of the process and provide assistance to students as needed to see them through to their ultimate goals. This active assessment of student success allows us to guide resources toward students most in need of support.We also track the overall success of our HSE program through pre-assessment as part of new student orientation and post-assessment for students who have completed 40 hours in HSE courses. This allows us to track the overall impact of the coursework in preparing the student both in terms of practical literacy skills and in terms of preparation for the HSE exams.The impact of the grant will extend beyond the direct vouchers provided to students. This financial incentive encourages students to participate in the Career Navigator session, which will be expanded and enhanced with additional curriculum. The impact on this course will be assessed through tracking of enrollment growth and through student satisfaction surveys of students who complete the course.

Funding from Dollar General will allow us to address our current waitlist of 42 people for classes, and 105 waiting for individual tutors by allowing us enough resources to open up additional seats in our classes (namely through the hiring and usage of teachers aides in the classrooms).Objectives of this program include: 260 students served in classes who study for at least one quarter will show significant learning gains in English Language Acquisition, as determined by periodic TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) testings. 25 students will gain employment and maintain employment for at least 1 year; 15 will earn US citizenship; and 10 will enroll in post-secondary training or education.","What all ESOL students have in common is the need to learn to speak English to fully participate in their community and become economically and socially self-sufficient.  Fluency in English is essential to get a job, manage health care, become educated consumers, raise a family, help your child succeed in school, become a US Citizen, and contribute to the community.  To reach these goals, our curriculum includes health literacy, financial literacy, computer literacy, occupational literacy, civics education and family literacy. The Literacy Center is the largest adult basic education program in the area and the only one that provides ESOL instruction. The agency is centrally located in downtown Attleboro, close to neighborhoods where our students live, allowing many of our students to walk.  It is also accessible by bus, making it the place of choice for many people who lack transportation.

Included in these data are our students' personal and professional goals; income information; demographic details; and educational history. Students are also asked to document income through the self-certification forms which allows them to check off an income range and the number of people in the family. When necessary we use interpreters to aid this process. TLC tracks attendance, learning gains, and the number of students who pursue citizenship.  We also track transition to employment, high school equivalency acquisition, or post-secondary education or training.  TLC utilizes several standardized testing methods to assess the effectiveness of our programs. We utilize TABE Class E and BEST PLUS tests to measure education gains in our student population.

Of these, 41 percent self-report speaking English less than ""very well,"" yet there is a clear correlation between English proficiency and economic prosperity for the foreign-born. A $15,000 grant from the Dollar General Literacy Foundation will help equalize the personal and professional opportunities of adult learners throughout New York City.Formal ESOL instruction has grown across the system, taking place at 49 libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and includes a host of elective courses on topics ranging from citizenship test prep to job readiness to math/numeracy. In 2018, the Library provided more than 19,000 seats for English language conversation groups at 49 branch libraries including Rikers Island Correctional Facility. The Library also helped over 5000 people on their path to U.S. Citizenship by providing information sessions, application assistance, test prep/study groups, citizenship classes, and legal services in 35 libraries.Due to temporary branch closures, in 2019 NYPL expects to serve approximately 18,000 attendees at drop-in citizenship prep classes and conversation groups and offer more than 13,000 class seats across 41 branches.","NYPL offers two tiers of English classes to its adult literacy students: ESOL instruction for non-native speakers and Adult Basic Education (ABE) courses for those who speak English but want to improve their reading and writing abilities. A large majority of the enrollment for both of these tracks is comprised of non-native English speakers--ninety percent of the Library's adult literacy students speak a first language other than English. By focusing on developing students' speaking and listening skills through ESOL instruction, and then offering reading and writing classes once students have progressed beyond ESOL, the Library supports all stages of the language learning process. While job search support has been a major component of the general ESOL program for years, in 2018, NYPL offered more intensive career development classes to its intermediate and advanced level students, helping them to develop personalized, long-term career goals and a strategy to achieve them. This specialized curriculum supports the development of basic language and literacy skills and improved critical thinking; simultaneously, students also learn how to accomplish practical, professional goals, such as navigating career databases, interpreting help wanted ads, assessing job offers, and matching their own interests to careers in rising industries.","To accommodate the wide variety of student needs and schedules, the Library's ESOL programming is offered in both formal, enrollment-based 10-week class cycles, and informal drop-in English conversation courses across 49 library locations, including NYPL's eight Adult Learning Centers and at Rikers Island. Classes are held year-round in four 10-week cycles: Fall (mid-September), Winter (end of January), Spring (early April) and Summer (end of June). Classes meet two days each week, for two hours each day. This format allows for maximum flexibility and helps the Library meet the myriad needs of its diverse constituency. All ESOL courses are led by NYPL staff and instructors, who receive regular professional development training to improve their efficacy. Between 65 and 70 teachers participate in quarterly meetings to share their lesson plans and teaching strategies, and to learn from one another. Recently covered topics have included integrating technology in the classroom, specialized instruction for job-seekers, and techniques for communicating effectively with students.This year, the Library is also piloting a new ESOL course focused on patrons seeking employment or professional advancement. Participants will learn how to accomplish practical, job-oriented goals such as navigating career databases, interpreting help wanted ads, assessing job offers, and matching their own interests to careers in rising industries, all in an English-language instruction setting.","At the end of every 10-week cycle, ESOL staff continue to assess students' educational gains using the BEST Plus oral proficiency exam and the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE). Staff also regularly survey students to measure their self-reported progress toward individual goals and program outcomes and to identify areas of potential improvement. Additionally, the Library tracks its students across cycles in order to determine educational gains. Long-term commitment is most likely to lead to maximum gains, so NYPL encourages its students to remain involved in the program for as many cycles as possible.In order to maintain the quality of instruction as the student population continues to grow, the Library has enacted frequent instructor evaluations and now requires its instructors to submit lesson plans for review prior to beginning a cycle of instruction. Each year, NYPL contracts with the Literacy Assistance Center, a not-for-profit professional development organization dedicated to building the capacity and improving the quality of adult literacy programs, to lead developmental workshops and training sessions for both ESOL management staff and instructors, including BEST Plus certification and re-certification for new and existing staff.","NYPL holds ESOL classes in 49 of its neighborhood libraries throughout the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island.

The Library has successfully used The Rosetta Stone, a popular language learning software, for years with beginners with excellent results. Additionally, adult learning centers use HEC Reading Horizons, a sequential intensive alphabetics program that helps students improve word recognition and fluency skills by providing individualized instruction with the added necessary element of repetition. Both ""courseware"" programs have extensive built in student monitoring capabilities that track student progress and time spent on lessons.

However, Lincoln's exceptionally low rate masks a steep challenge: our community's persistent skills gap traps about one-fifth of young families in poverty while stressing local businesses unable to find qualified workers. More than 90% of those who seek our services are LMI, with most in poverty. Lincoln Literacy has raised its sights to provide additional services aimed at upgrading low-income residents' qualifications for the workplace.","The overall dropout rate at Lincoln Public Schools is low -- just 6.2 percent. However, the population we serve, being largely composed of New Americans, has a much higher risk of children not graduating from high school.

We'll provide English language and basic literacy services, plus a wide range of skill-building opportunities, including financial literacy, digital literacy, certified nursing assistant prep, GED prep, teacher prep, and citizenship. Based on history we expect these services to be transformative. Parents will get living wage jobs, children will thrive in school, and families will read together. ","Lincoln Literacy is committed to meaningful services and measuring results. Each year, we expect two-thirds of our adult English Language Learners to advance by at least one level on the Basic English Skills Test (BEST). For adult literacy learners we had been using the TABE, but we determined that it takes so long to administer that it deters students. Therefore, we worked with our local university's graduate education department to develop a shorter, friendlier literacy assessment. We expect two-thirds of our adult literacy learners to progress on that each year. For the children in our program, we developed measures based on Lincoln Public Schools standards for early literacy acquisition as well as key elementary school behaviors. These include paying attention,  participating, taking turns,  and raising hands before speaking. We expect 80% of the children to meet school-based learning and behavioral goals.In 2018, 72% of adult English Language Learners advanced by a level or more on the BEST, 60% of adult literacy learners made measurable progress, and 79% of children achieved literacy and learning goals.Based on our projected service figures and benchmarks, we expect:594 adult English Language Learners will advance by a level or more on the BEST, and 32 adult literacy learners will demonstrate measurable progress on post-assessment, and152 children will meet age-appropriate literacy and learning goals.","ELLA is designed to meet community and individual needs through highly personalized and caring instruction provided by trained volunteers. Our many awards distinguish us as the community's leader in free language and literacy services. What's more, we alone make it possible for even the most isolated, dispirited, and impoverished to access learning opportunities in an intimate, encouraging, and personalized setting.  Only Lincoln Literacy offers free van transportation for those in need, free on-site childcare, and a wide network of classes seven days a week, with offerings mornings, afternoons, and evenings. We're unique in deploying trained volunteer tutors who form warm, mentoring relationships with each student. We alone provide teachers for their refugee children to ensure that they succeed in school. Finally, our partnerships with schools, businesses, churches, community centers, and other nonprofits give us unmatched reach into the community. This is likely why in a year when some of our sister organizations saw steep declines in clientele, our enrollments held steady. At each site we assess the students and divide them up into groups of similar level, each with their own tutor. We provide textbooks, supplementary materials, teaching technology, and on-site coordination and support. Most classes meet twice a week for 90 minutes each time, a few meet once a week, and one site has classes four days a week.

","As recorded in the previous section, Lincoln Literacy's primary objective measure of progress for adult English Language Learners is the Basic English Skills Test (BEST). It comes in alternate versions, allowing for pre-and-post testing. It provides an accurate assessment that can be translated into meaningful descriptive terms, such as ""functional in a setting with limited English demands.""For the much smaller number of adult literacy learners we serve, our pre and post literacy assessments perform a similar function. The assessment measures alphanumeric competence, spelling ability, punctuation, grammar, reading comprehension, and reading fluency. We expect two-thirds of our adult learners in either category to advance by a level or more on  these measures each year.For the refugee and immigrant children in our FLAIR program (FLAIR stands for ""family literacy activities for immigrants and refugees""), we have developed assessments with the assistance of the guidance of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln based on at kindergarten and early Elementary standards set by Lincoln Public Schools. These include measures of English language literacy, including letter recognition, image vocabulary association, emergent reading, beginning writing, and a suite of school readiness behaviors that include making eye contact, paying attention, responding appropriately, resolving conflict peacefully, taking turns, and other behaviors previously mentioned. ","Thanks to our partners, Lincoln Literacy has a vast array of facilities at its disposal. At each of the learning sites, our host makes available between three and five classrooms. Many of the schools, churches, and community centers make child care space available as well. Even the jail makes two classrooms available, one of which can be subdivided into three teaching spaces. The libraries make space available for classes and intakes. For transportation, Lincoln Literacy makes use of two 12-passenger vans that it owns. The vans operate each day except Sunday. Lincoln Literacy employs three van drivers for that purpose.For instruction, Lincoln Literacy maintains a library of textbooks and teaching resources such as the Oxford Picture Dictionary and Easy Stories and subscribes to 10 copies a week of the easy-to-read News for You. Tutors may borrow books for free. Students may purchase them at a subsidized rate of $10 each. For students who cannot afford that we reduce or waive the charge altogether. Additionally, Lincoln Literacy has a growing collection of downloadable lesson plans and teaching materials available to tutors via our website.

For tutors we have offered instruction in blended learning. With students we simplified the concept to a slogan: ""Learn every day."" Since no one can meet with a volunteer tutor every day, we've taught our students how to use their cell phones or other technology to extend learning beyond the classroom.  But first we needed to integrate our far-flung network of services and make available more classroom technology. With grants from the Sherwood and Cooper foundations, we completely renovated our office network at the beginning of 2018 with 20 new, high-end workstations connected by a high-speed server network. Using Google Suite, we've extended that network into the field. We've equipped each of our dozen field coordinators with a new Chromebook, and purchased 10 more for use in classrooms. We also have six for loan to students. (Five of the six are currently out on loan.) With a Rotary grant we were able to purchase three more to lend to low-income families for home use, along with four month's of home internet (after which they can obtain a $15/mo. low-income connection). Additionally, we have two projectors, a hotspot, and a pay-as-you-go cellphone available for classroom use. These efforts have paid off.

","Classes are concentrated in neighborhoods that are densely populated with immigrants, most living below the poverty level. In 2016, Morrisville had a poverty rate of 11.7%. The UN Refugee Agency  refers the most vulnerable cases to host countries for resettlement, so we serve very young, elderly, disabled, or ill refugees, or survivors of violence or torture. About 75% of our students were living at or below poverty in 2018; these are people who need to start over in a new country. ","The rate of literacy in Phila., adjacent to Bucks County is 22%. Available statistics for Bucks were 9% for 2003. NJ is 17% and Trenton is 14%. Nearly half of WTS students in Morrisville classes are from Trenton.",,"In 2018 we held 59 classes over 3 terms, serving 853 students. We teach survival vocabulary to fit students' situational needs, (i.e. housing, jobs, resumes, healthcare, etc). Skills are cumulative, but each lesson stands alone, in case classes are missed. Goal: 80% retention, or 10% above initial skills. ","Language is the key that opens the door to job prospects, community involvement, and furthering educational opportunities for immigrants, refugees and their families. Our objective is to offer free lessons, tailored to each student's personal needs, including 59 classes (both day and evening) in 3 twelve week terms during the year. We help students learn the language skills they need to communicate with employers, helps them create resumes and prepare for job interviews, handle financial transactions, communicate with their children's doctors and teachers. We respond to the shifting needs of those we help by adjusting and changing our curriculum so they can develop the communication survival skills they need to thrive in their communities. Our goal is to retain 600 out of 800 enrolled students, and strive for students to receive 80% or higher assessment scores using formative and summative assessments. In 2018 we added 66 new volunteers (215 total) to keep up with substantial growth in student enrollment (146% increase in students since 2015). Human impact of our classes: A victim of human trafficking and sexual abuse has earned her GED, found a job, and learned to drive. A Syrian father with only a 4th grade education who spent his teen years in a refugee camp, now has English skills and has gotten his first job ever.","According to the National Institute for Literacy, the greatest barriers adult students have in taking classes are time, childcare, and transportation. We strive to overcome these barriers by offering day and evening classes, and providing classes in neighborhoods that have dense populations of immigrant and refugee families (so students can walk to class). Students attend classes held in community centers, schools, churches, and businesses. By working with area non-profits, Welcoming the Stranger ensures reasonable operating costs and a continuous source of student referrals. Paid instructors are assisted by over 70 trained volunteers, so there is a high ratio of teachers and volunteers to adult learners, which allows us to focus on each student's personal needs. Literacy level students can learn the alphabet and phonics, and learn to read and write for the first time with one on one instruction. Students searching for jobs work in small groups on resumes, cover letters, interview skills, and job search terminology. Others may learn skills such as how to talk to a doctor, get access to health services, communicate with their children's teachers, or navigate their community. Advanced students increase comprehension and vocabulary by reading articles, novels, or technical language related to jobs. The program also results in community building, as we refer students to community resources, and involve them in American culture. In 2018 we also held 15 workshops with 130 students.","In 2018, we held a total of 59 classes in three 12 week terms and served 853 (unduplicated) students. ESL classes (i.e. Morrisville) met twice a week for 90 minutes, equaling 36 hrs. a semester, and 108 hours for 3 semesters. Instructional hours rise if students attend other offered classes within a semester. Terms begin in January, April, and September. The Dollar General Foundation grant will come in time to support the third term of the calendar/fiscal year 2019. By the report, Welcoming the Stranger will have completed one term and will be able to report on student progress and number of students served. ","Comprehension of class materials is based on in-class observation, student work samples, and testing. Through formative and summative assessments, our English language teachers compare students' progress from the beginning to the end of each term. Although our beginner English students are not given written tests, their English comprehension is monitored through observational assessment as well as receptive questioning (this is a common technique used in ESL programming in public education). For example, students get a page with 6 pictures on it. The teacher tells them, ""Circle the picture of the dog."" In this case, they are provided with the word ""dog"" but they have to connect the word to the picture. This is then repeated for the rest of the list of vocabulary words. Our higher level English students are able to complete written assessment and can be assessed with expressive questioning, where students are actively using and producing language. These assessments are then used to determine curriculum.","WTS uses books, white boards, computers, pen, paper, and various individually drawn up curriculum worksheets. Many educational supplies are donated through the year, but we have a large collection of curriculum housed at our office. For our facilities, WTS works with partners within each community to keep class spaces either rent free or as low cost as possible. Our Morrisville classes are held in partnership with the Ivins Outreach Center (a human services non-profit), Morrisville High School, and Morrisville United Methodist Church. The Ivins Outreach Center utilizes Morrisville High School as one of their sites, and allows us to come into the classroom space available after school hours to hold our ESL class. Morrisville United Methodist Church allows us to use Sunday school classrooms that they are not using during the week. All of these generous partners allow us to use the sites free of charge, and we pay a discounted rent for our main office at another site. ","Since we are guests in the space we teach in, we typically do not use much technology in the Morrisville classroom. We write on white boards and distribute curriculum in paper packets. As the occasion calls for it, teachers may use their Smartphones or tablets to play a sound clip, show a video, or bring up a picture related to the lesson.

We are requesting funding in the amount of $15,000.00 to cover the cost of part of our Morrisville area classes, which encompasses four classes that our Program Coordinator oversees and teaches. A single ESL class is supported through the general operating budget of Welcoming the Stranger. Most of our grant money comes from private foundations. No monies have been given through federal, state or county governments. Our greatest level of support is through individual contributions from loyal donors. Our 2018, individual contributions totaled $65,000.00 , over 60% of our annual budget. We request that Dollar General provide part of the salary line for staff needed to run four ESL classes for a year. If Dollar General would be so generous as to provide the full budget line for instructional materials, supplies, and printing costs, this would allow us to sustain the materials in several classes for a year. Materials include worksheets and packets for students, curriculum books, flashcards, whiteboards and supplies, pens, pencils, paper, and photocopying of newspaper and magazine articles and other such materials used in class.

The software will enable our program to create a hybrid model to reach more students in our 11 county service area. The TABE Academy software will build basic skills while the GED Academy software will enhance the basic skills to pass the reading language arts component of the GED. ,"The program objective is to provide literacy skills to a larger population in our service areas.  By providing a hybrid model where students can come to class periodically but continually focus through online opportunities on skill deficiencies, we will be able to reach more students. Students in both face-to-face and hybrid models will be pre-assessed to determine the learning path needed to help them successfully read and comprehend material presented.  Students from both models will then be post-tested to determine growth and modify the learning path developed.  Students will be assigned an instructor to oversee their learning plan to ensure they are making progress toward increasing a level on the TABE assessment.  This instrument (the TABE assessment) will be used to determine the success of the students. ","The Reading Transforms design will be implemented through the Adult Education program at Oconee Fall Line Technical College. The average percentage of individuals without a high diploma in our service area is 12.2%. Many of these individuals have jobs that prevent them from attending classes on a regular basis even though we offer flexible schedules. By implementing a hybrid model where individuals with a schedule that prevents them from coming to a class, we can reach more people and provide a service that will in turn benefit our communities. We can increase the literacy rate in adults to give them opportunities to further their education and/or obtain a job that will help them better provide for their families. According to a blog by Concordia University in Portland, illiteracy in adults has far reaching effects on future generations. Seventy-two percent of students whose parents have low literacy rates face increased challenges in school. Seventy-five percent of state prison inmates did not complete their high school diploma or are classified with low levels of literacy (https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/education-news-roundup/illiteracy-in-america/).Through the implementation of this hybrid model we can better serve future students.  Teachers will be trained on the use of the new programs to ensure the investment in the TABE Academy and GED Academy software is effective. The laptops purchased will be available to students in both in class and hybrid models.","The time period for students participating in this design will be 15 weeks.  At the beginning of the period, all adult education students in the in-class and hybrid models will be given the TABE 11 pre-assessment in reading according to the requirements of the assessment.  The results of the assessment will be entered into the TABE Academy software for students in the hybrid model which will develop a learning plan for each student.  The students will commit to 6 hours per week of instruction through the TABE Academy software.  Once the students have accumulated 40 hours of work in the software, they will come to the Oconee Fall Line Testing Center to take the TABE post assessment. The results will be evaluated to determine if the students progressed from their current level to the next level.  At this point the students who gained a level will continue working on their learning. If the students did not increase a level, a meeting will be scheduled with their instructor to determine what additional support is needed. ","The TABE 11/12 assessment will be used as the measurement tool for our design.  Students will be assessed when they accumulate between 40-50 hours from the previous assessment. For a student to show growth, they should progress to the next ABE level after accumulating at least 40 hours of instruction. The new TABE 11&12 tests are secure, reliable, and valid assessments used to assess the achievement of examinees on core content areas taught and assessed as part of Adult Basic Education programs nationwide. The TABE test is aligned to the national College and Career Readiness Standards for the three core subject areas: Reading, Mathematics, and Language. ",Each of the eleven counties in the service area have a facility available for students to participate in the hybrid model. Instructors will be fully trained on the implementation of the model as well as how to track each student's progress. Some of our sites are in rural areas so the use of laptops will be necessary to conduct the required testing for TABE 11/12.  Technical support will be available to install needed software to carry out the project.,Currently there are approximately 16 laptops available for use in the 11 counties we serve.  The laptops average from one to five years old.  ,Yes,"With the funding provided in this grant along with matching funds, we are requesting the purchase of 22 laptops.

Clients in the agency's residential and recovery programs cannot leave the building to attend offsite classroom-based GED and ABE programs. Yet, Haymarket clients are hampered by the agency's aging technology infrastructure and financial pressures that prevent it from investing in technology upgrades necessary to support online learning and credit recovery programs. These financial pressures also prevent the agency from offering financial assistance to clients as they complete Renewed Learning and take the four GED subject exams. With an initial investment of $12,000 from Dollar General Literacy Foundation to purchase a classroom set of 15 desktop computers, Haymarket Center's Renewed Learning will leverage an existing relationship with Malcolm X College to improve delivery of ABE and GED classes and study materials for to up to 125 clients in the first year of the program.

We provide one-on-one tutoring in addition to evening group classes, as well as provide resources for students to take home and practice between sessions. We are expecting to serve at least 160  students in 2019, with each student who attends tutoring sessions on a regular basis and works on assigned activities outside of tutoring to improve by at least 1 level according to our CASAS assessments and book levels.","We serve adults in Rowan County who lack basic literacy skills, meaning they are unable to read or write. In the case of our English as a Second Language students, this typically means they are unable to read, write, speak or comprehend English. We do an initial assessment using CASAS to determine their beginning literacy point, and reassess after every 70-100 hours of instruction. We commit to raising every student's level by at least 1, provided they are diligent about attending tutoring sessions and working between sessions.We have 4 ESL students who have identified their main goal as passing the U.S. Citizenship Exam. We anticipate that all 4 will do so by the end of the year. We just launched our own app for tutors and students, which allows them to remain in better contact in between tutoring sessions, as well as provides students with free materials such as e-books, word games and puzzles, a word-of-the-day and a dictionary. We also use Spark3000 for students to use in between tutoring sessions.","Each student is matched with a tutor that works with them individually for at least 1.5 hours per week, as well as assigns additional work to be completed in between tutoring sessions. Many of our pairs meet more than the minimum of 1.5 hours, time permitting. We also offer an Advanced ESL group conversation class, which allows students who do not speak English at home to get practice in a group setting.In 2017 we also began an Evening ESL group class, since most of our tutors are available only during the day. This class is led by an experienced ESL teacher and meets two evenings per week. Both sessions filled up within 48 hours so we will be offering the class at least 4 times during the 2019 year.","Our programs are ongoing with no specific end date, except for the Evening ESL class, which runs for 8 weeks at a time.Many of our students come with a specific goal- to obtain their GED, citizenship, employment, etc. After they have achieved those goals, some leave the program, while others stay to improve their overall literacy.","We use CASAS assessments when the student initially signs up for our program, and then we  retest after every 70-100 hours of instruction. We also use Spark3000 with students who have access to the necessary technology (computer/internet or ability to come to us and use our computers).","Our administrative offices are located in the main branch of the Rowan County Library.

Employment Security Commission, unemployment in Woodward County and Harper County is 2.3% and 2.0% in Ellis County.  The largest employers in our area are oil/gas industry and agriculture.  The majority of our students are employed in these two areas.  ","Drop-out rates do not have a big impact on our program since we are mainly providing English-language acquisition.  In Woodward County, 12.6% of the population did not complete high school.  12.2% of the population in Woodward County is Hispanic, and 25% of the school population is Hispanic.  Our organization is the only agency providing English-language acquisition for adults within 100 miles.  We are also helping four of our Hispanic adult students to prepare for the GED.  ","Northwest Oklahoma is sparsely populated.  Woodward is the largest county in the area, and the poverty level moves between 11 and 12 %.  Dewey and Ellis Counties, which are largely agriculture based, have higher poverty rates, between 17 and 22%.  The oil/gas industry has been improving but it is slow.  Many of our students are employed at area pig farms, and their employment has held steady.  ","The 2013 American Community Survey report ranked Oklahoma as one of the states with the largest increase in foreign language speakers from 2000-2013....up 48%.  In We have certainly seen a marked increase in our area. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, 14% of adults in Woodward County lack basic literacy skills, 13% in Dewey County, 12% in Harper County, and 11% in Ellis County.  ",,"We expect to serve around 100 adult students both by private/small group tutoring and in our area night classes. English-language acquisition instruction and basic literacy tutoring will be provided.  Additionally, we offer tutoring for those adult students seeking to pass the U.S. citizenship exam and the Okla. driver's license written exam.  After 80 hours of instruction, all adult students are expected to gain at least one literacy level as indicated by the CASAS etest assessment.  ","The overall objective of our ESL program is to better enable our adult students to read, write, and speak English.  In order to improve teacher/tutor effectiveness, all three of our teachers will be offered three in-services, throughout the year.  These in-services will focus on strategies and methods for improving student learning and retention and analyzing student assessment results.  All 12 tutors will be offered six, two-hour in-services for the same purpose.  The goal will be to maintain all teachers and tutors throughout the year, with 100% of the teachers and 75% of the tutors attending all in-services.Another goal will be to compile at least 4000 instructional hours (including both volunteer tutoring hours and paid instructional hours) for the year.  This goal can be assessed through the monthly attendance logs that all tutors and teachers  submit. This data is then entered into the Literacy Tracker data base. This year will be the first year that we are using the CASAS assessment system, which must be administered electronically.  The goal for assessment is that each students in our night classes and in private tutoring will be given the CASAS after they have completed 12 hours of classroom instruction.  Then after 80 hours of instruction, the student will be re-assessed.  Of course, not all students will complete 80 hours of instruction, but our end goal will be for 50% of our students to improve by at least one performance level on the CASAS.  ","We serve our students in two ways: one-on-one/small group tutoring for basic literacy and ESL and night classes for ESL only. We design our program around the goals of our students, as they are revealed to us during the intake process.  Students can then select which program (tutoring or night class) will work for his/her schedule, and some of our students do both.  However, most of our students are employed, so we serve the vast majority of our students at our night classes. We offer a Beginning English and an Intermediate English night class in Woodward, and Beginning English in Laverne.  We had to close our Beginning English satellite class in Buffalo because of low attendance.  However, our teacher is now tutoring her remaining three students, but we do not employ her. She is now a volunteer tutor for the NWOLC.  During student intake, we also offer one-on-one tutoring for those students seeking U.S. citizenship and/or an Oklahoma driver's license.  However, we only tutor for the written exam part of the driver's license process.  We also offer our advanced students GED prep, and we have four students who are presently working toward that goal.  We publish a brochure in Spanish that details our services, and the brochure is prominently displayed at area businesses and restaurants.  It was also included in the enrollment packet for the Woodward Public Schools' English language learners.   Our director speaks to many area organizations about our services.  ","Our ESL night classes enroll in August, begin in early September, and end in July.  We have added summer school classes this year at the request of our students.  Our Beginning English class meets twice weekly for two hours each time.  Our Intermediate English class meets once weekly for a two-hour class, and this is also how our satellite class in Laverne meets.  Our program coordinator begins pre-testing in late September and finishes in late October.  At semester time in January, she pretests all students who enrolled late, as all of our night classes have open enrollment throughout the year.  Post-testing begins in May and finishes in June.  Teacher in-services are held in August, November, and June. Assessment and attendance data are discussed at each meeting and used to make curriculum adjustments.  The NWOLC hosts holiday parties for our three night classes and an end-of-the-year celebration in late May for all our students and their families.  Student achievement and attendance are spotlighted at both events, and our board members also attend both events.  Individualized tutoring occurs year-round, with all tutoring sessions lasting from one to two hours.  Professional development for our 12 volunteer tutors is on-going, with six three-hour sessions scheduled throughout the year. Topics for professional development include assessment, curriculum review, and instructional strategies.  We honor our tutors at a November event which is also attended by their students.   ","The Literacy Tracker's Program At A Glance report is very helpful tool tor yearly assessment of effectiveness since we can compare data from 20018 to data from 2017, etc.  This review is performed at our annual May Board of Directors meeting. The Oklahoma Dept. of Libraries grant, which funds the director's salary, also requires us to set goals and objectives for assessing program effectiveness.  These goals must be measurable and each must include a standard for success.  Goals 3 and 4 pertain to our goals for the DG grant. Goal 3: To improve teacher and tutor effectiveness through professional development activities. The standard of success for Goal 3 is to retain all present tutors and teachers with 100% of the teachers attending all three in-services and 75% of the tutors attending all six tutor trainings.  Goal 4: To improve student retention in all ESL night classes and in all individual/small group tutoring.  The standards of success are 1) to compile 4000 instructional hours for the year.and 2) for each student who receives 80 hours of instruction to improve by at least one performance level, as evidenced by both a pre and post CASAS assessment.  All of this data is recorded on a monthly basis in the Literacy Tracker data base so it will be easy to evaluate our success.  ","The two classrooms in Woodward for our ESL night classes are excellent.  They both have wi-fi access  and computer/LCD screens.  One has a Smart Board which our teacher uses.  Our Intermediate English class has access to a computer lab, which has excellent ESL and GED prep software programs.  Our satellite class in Laverne meets in a church, and wi-fi access is available, so we purchased a laptop for the teacher's use during class.  The Woodward Public Library provides tutoring space for our tutors and a meeting room for our board meetings & small group tutoring.  The Woodward Public Library is also where the director/program coordinator offices.  All books, instructional supplies, and laptops are stored in the office.  ",Our Beginning English teacher uses a computer/LCD screen during her lessons.  Our Intermediate English teacher uses a Smart Board with her lessons.  Our satellite teacher uses a laptop for her lessons.  Our Intermediate English class has access to a computer lab and it is utilized often.  The NWOLC owns 3 laptops which are used for CASAS assessments and for direct instruction by our tutors.  One of our 3 laptops is brand new and we plan to purchase two more this year.

Here is the cost breakdown: $8800 for salaries for 3 part-time teachers for 11 months.  We are adding more class time this year, since all three teachers would like to offer summer classes.

As our students (and students nationwide) struggle primarily with math and reading comprehension, this structure has been effective.GED/HSE Level 1: Students receive a beginner course in math, covering basic mathematical operations, as well as the foundations of algebra and geometry. At this level, students are being prepared to move to Level 2.Proficiency in Level 1 is measured using a rubric including CASAS and TABE (see Assessment below) post-test scores, homework, attendance, and overall classroom performance.GED/HSE Level 2: After proving competency in GED/HSE Level 1, students move to Level 2 reviewing previous topics and moving deeper into algebra and geometry. Level 2 students focus on the goal of taking the High School Equivalency Official Practice Test (OPT).Individual tutoring is always available to all students and is usually incorporated for help in specific areas and/or when a student is very close to testing and would benefit from a focused review.

The program uses the Career Foundations curriculum, which helps students who read at a 4th grade level or above or who speak limited English assess their skills and interests, explore career paths, and craft a plan to advance to college.Community Literacy provides informal ESL, ABE, or Civics instruction through one-on-one tutoring at our West Town and Little Village sites as well as partner sites on Chicago's west side. The one-on-one tutoring format allows adult learners access to instruction based on their schedules providing the flexibility needed for those who work irregular schedules precluding them from attending more formal classes.Weekly Technology Education provided by Erie House's Workforce Development program provides basic, intermediate and advanced technology classes for adults providing both software and hardware skills. ","The timeline for accomplishing the outcomes stated above applies to fiscal year 2020 (July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020). ESL and Community Literacy classes operate on a semester schedule with fall and spring sessions. ESL classes are held at our site in Little Village (4225 W 25th St., Chicago, IL 60623) Monday through Thursday in the morning (9-11am) and evening (6-9pm) for a total of eight weekly instructional hours provided per student. Community Literacy has open enrollment with year-round services. Drop-in tutoring sessions are offered daily at our site in West Town and partner sites in West Town, Wicker Park, Logan Square, and Belmont-Cragin. Participants in our Community Literacy program receive at least two hours of tutoring per week. Technology classes typically last six months, during which time students meet three hours per week, for a total of 72 hours of instruction.  ","Erie House utilizes the CASA measurement tool for ESL, the TABE measurement tool for Adult Basic Education, and Community Literacy utilizes BEST. All three programs also use student goals sheets and surveys to assess effectiveness. In addition, Erie Neighborhood House currently tracks data using Efforts to Outcomes (ETO), a database which tracks demographics, attendance, social-emotional surveys, report card data, and other outcome related data. Throughout various programs at Erie, different funding agencies may require reporting through their own funder-mandated databases. However, Erie's Database Administrator works to consistently refresh the information logged into outlying databases back to Erie's ETO software to ensure Erie has one consistent, reliable source of information about progress and impact in any given program. At Erie House participant feedback is extremely important to us. We use our student surveys as well as teacher and program evaluations to understand what students want and if they feel like they are happy with their learning outcomes. For example students have constantly indicated that they need more conversation practice. This has lead our teachers to incorporate more conversation into their daily lesson plans as well as offer conversation outside of class time. We have tutors through community literacy who are able to come to Little Village on Friday and offer conversation tutoring that is free and open to all students in our ESL and ABE classes.","Erie House's Little Village site is located at 4225 W 25th St., Chicago, IL 60623. Little Village has four classrooms used for ESL instruction and a technology center for participant use during open access times. Since 2011, Erie House has been renovating and upgrading our classroom and lab space in Little Village. We have recently launched a capital campaign to build a permanent center in Little Village, where our community resources will be expanded.Erie House's West Town site is located at 1347 W Erie St., Chicago, IL 60642.

In 2017, Erie House received a donation from Comcast allowing us to purchase new computers for our computer lab. Instructors utilize projectors and large monitors linked to computers during class time to share videos and movies, which help participants become more familiar with the English language.Erie House actively promotes digital inclusion for low-income families. Erie House currently offers adults classes in basic, intermediate, and advanced computer literacy at both our West Town and Little Village sites, and all participants have access to Erie House's Community Technology Centers to use ESL software, type assignments, and conduct internet research. There are 12 desktop computers, 33 lap tops, and one server at the Little Village site, and there are 31 desktops and one server at the West Town site.

We serve over 300 women and 100 kids each year. We provide  High School Equivalency, English as a Second Language, Citizenship Test Prep, Computer Basics, Sewing and onsite childcare.  Over 70% of families living in poverty are headed by single mothers By focusing on education for women and their children, we are helping move families out of poverty.","When a mothers education level improves, her children's reading and writing skills automatically improve.   Children of women without a high school diploma are ""more likely to be unemployed, three times as likely to live in poverty and eight times as likely to be incarcerated"" (TN Dept of Workforce Dev).  Long-term economic impact on the community is increased by an average of $10,000 annually per individual.  Studies have indicated that when women gain income, the money is more likely to be spent on nutrition, medicine and housing, and consequently their children are healthier. For every dollar a woman earns, $.80 are invested back into her family compared to 30 cents by men. At DLC we serve only women and seek to give them the necessary tools to transform their lives and the lives of their families. Around 80% of the women we serve are mothers with the majority, 78% having young children under the age of 10. Most our students are between 18-45 years old and more than half, over 60% come to us unemployed with an average 9th grade level education.

","Our overall purpose is to present opportunities for women to overcome obstacles and achieve a high school equivalency diploma; gain literacy skills; and obtain sustainable employment. We know the women we serve will inspire their children to achieve their own educational goals. Mothers and care givers are much more likely to read to children, help with homework and participate in scholastic activities, if they have the skills and education to do so. Children in turn are much more likely to succeed in school if they have actively involved caregivers/adults. We partner with other local family service agencies to receive and provide referrals. We work with Shelby County Schools and head-starts, and participate in community and other outreach events. At registration, students are assessed using officially recognized testing methods: CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessments) for High School Equivalency; and BEST (Basic English Skills Test) for ESL. These assessments determine skill level and class placement. High School Equivalency classes are offered in math, language arts, science, and social studies using the Kaplan HiSET Exam 2017-2018 Strategies, Practice & Review textbook. ESL classes range from basic to level three and utilize the Oxford Picture Dictionary (OPD) series of textbooks and workbooks.   We offer a traditional academic calendar ","Our program is modeled using a traditional academic calendar with fall, spring and summer semesters (minimum of 38 academic weeks annually) that correspond with the Shelby County Public Schools to better accommodate mothers.  Morning classes are held Monday through Thursday from 9:00 am to noon and evening classes are Monday through Wednesday 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm.DLC works to alleviate barriers that often prevent women from furthering their education by providing childcare and flexible schedules. We conduct monthly enrichment workshops to help address health and wellness and other issues. We provide resources, referrals and emergency needs assistance as available. Additionally, we offer transportation assistance for our students as needed. Our Center is in midtown Memphis with several convenient MATA bus stops and we work with students to purchase bus passes or gas cards. ","To ensure program success we continually monitor student progress by tracking attendance and conducting assessment tests. The High School Equivalency program prepares students for the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET). Upon completion the HiSET/GED credential provides certification of high school level education. Students are pre-tested at registration using the CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessments) and then attend HiSET classes: reading and writing (language arts), science, social studies and math. They are periodically given practice tests for teachers to assess progress. With successful classroom attendance, participation and practice testing, students can take the OPT (Official Practice Test) to determine readiness for passing the HiSET exam. If the appropriate scores are achieved for each subject, students are then cleared to register for the HiSET exam. The ESL (English as a Second Language) program teaches the listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English to students for whom English is not their native language. Students are pre-tested using the BEST test (Basic English Skills Test) and assigned to the appropriate ESL class: basic, level 1, level 2, or level 3. ESL student progress is tracked using attendance and comparison of pre and post BEST (Basic English Skills Test) test scores. Students must successfully complete two semesters of each level and achieve the appropriate BEST score to move to the next level.

The New American Economy 2019 report reveals that immigrants in Louisville Metro, KY, in addition to paying $430 million in taxes in 2016, play a vital role in driving population growth and the labor force. Unemployment among this population remains low locally because of ESL literacy programs like that of CCL-MRS.","Our clients' education and employment have been disrupted by months and/or years of interrupted learning. Many were forced out of their home countries and came to the US without possessions or assets. When they are resettled in Louisville, CCL-MRS helps them acquire the skills they need to stabilize, such as literacy and employment. This population would be considered 100% drop out since they are rebuilding their lives in a new country. ","According to The Urban Institute's ""A Profile of the Foreign-Born in the Louisville Metropolitan Area,"" Louisville's immigrants are more likely to be poor than U.S.-born Louisville residents.

The models vary, but the machines currently in use are 11 years old on average. In the last year, 5 workstations have become unusable due to irreparable hardware failures or other problems associated with aging technology. This reduces the number of usable workstations to 11. A major concern is that if this pattern continues and the machines are not replaced, the computer program may become impossible to maintain.Over the last 4 months, 58 enrolled enrolled into our ESL program, all of whom are eligible for computer instruction. However, with average class size of 15 to 20 students in two of the three classes, it is impossible for a whole class to attend computers at the same time. The need to break students into groups disrupts the continuity of the curriculum, causes confusion for students and staff, and cuts into instructional time.A further drain on valuable instructional time is the long loading times and unexpected technical problems that are a daily occurrence in an outdated laboratory. In addition to being disruptive, these challenges make it much more difficult for first-time computer users to improve, as they struggle to distinguish between user error and computer error. Outside of class, excessive instructor time must be spent keeping the machines in the best working order possible, detracting from the time needed for planning and class administration.",Yes,"Students of all English levels attend computer lessons regularly, where they learn essential skills appropriate for their level of English and literacy.

They will be able to read to their children/grandchildren, read road signs (obtain driver's license), complete job applications, and read prescriptions and other health information correctly.  Our objective is to make the biggest impact possible on literacy issues in the region, so we created a new On-Site Learning Alliance program.  Through this program, we partner with local organizations to provide our services at their site, but do not have transportation to come to our location.  This is a first huge step to removing the many barriers to improvement that our potential clients face.  Individuals going through our program will see increased levels of reading abilities and positive life changes such as obtainment of a high school diploma, driver's license and/or completion of job applications, and potentially employment gains.

We require each learner to complete 12 hours of software and/or print instruction with our Director of Education prior to being paired with a tutor, regardless of their reading level. We use the Reading Horizons Elevate software, which is web-based making it readily available to them in our computer lab or off-site.  It is a comprehensive, multi-sensory system ran through filtered internet at the center. Learners average one hour per session until they complete the required 12 hours.  During this time, learners are given a foundation of literacy instruction, and we develop a better understanding of the individual's needs.  This helps us identify effective instructional strategies, which are relayed to the tutor. Students can schedule lab time or walk-in at any time.  Staff analyzes new student assessments to set personal educational plans. Learners are then paired with appropriate tutors. We provide continual support to student/tutor pairs. Monthly reports are generated to track overall effectiveness of our program, which allows us to celebrate successes and address issues or concerns.  Data tracked includes new assessment information, current number of learners and instruction type, total instructional hours, goal progress/gains, and number and qualifications of tutors.  ","The stated outcomes for our BAL clients to show gains will be within a 12 month period.   The computer lab is open 32 hours per week, Monday through Thursday.  The process for a student to complete the assessment, then move on to software instruction, and then to tutor pairing takes about three months on average.  The recommended instruction time per week for each adult literacy learner is two hours.  The recommended instruction time for a HSE student is 6 hours per week.","Adult literacy learners are assessed with one of the following:  READ, Laubach Way to Reading, or Challenger series assessments.  We also utilize the reporting tools available to us through the Reading Horizons software.  We reassess our literacy learners after every 100 hours of instructional time.  Our HSE learners are assessed by the TABE and are reassessed after approximately 40-50 hours of instruction.  Learners may also be assessed with a soft skills/life skills assessment tool depending on their individual goals and a digital literacy assessment.   Learner information and their instructional hours are tracked using LACES, a comprehensive adult literacy database.  We also keep a paper tracking sheet inside student files. Student lab progress is monitored and measured through Reading Horizons and paper sign-in sheets recorded daily.  Tutors provide reports on student instructional hours monthly and that data is input into LACES.  We will also track the total number served and new student assessments each month to ensure we are increasing our impact.

","Adult educators are passionate about what they do; they know the direct impact they can have on people's lives. With technology offering so much promise, the Lab offers a unique leadership development opportunity to promote entrepreneurship and encourage technology integration for both learners and instructors.CCLC plans to serve 750 adult learners, 645 learners that participate in the program will report that IDLL increased their confidence to use technology and 640 will state that the technology aided them in understanding their future education and employment paths. From previous technology projects (Adult Learner Technology Integration Project or ALTIP) we know that of 1,084 learners, 726 learners reported that the ""use of computers increased my desire to attend class and complete projects.""  In addition to building adult learner confidence, ALTIP improved instructor confidence and technology adoption. 74% of instructors reported that, ""Greater use of technologies had a positive impact on attendance,"" and 86% reported that ""Greater use of technology had a positive impact on student learning outcomes in the reading."" As the Illinois Digital Learning Lab is adopted by CCLC we anticipate similar findings. ALTIP program participants gained an average of 1.4 grade levels on the TABE during the program year. Many providers reported that the technology expedited learner grade-level gains.

Included in this number are 446,435 adults with less than a 9th grade education. Approximately 2.8 million Illinois residents speak a language other than English as the primary language in their homes. English literacy skills for entry and advancement in the labor force are needed by many of these residents. More than 332,275 immigrants are currently residing in Illinois. English literacy and civics education provides individuals with a pathway to citizenship, improved education, and employment.With this grant support, CCLC will adopt the IDLL prototype and launch, implement and manage its 2019-2020 class. The project will have two sprints over the course of the academic year for educators and learners to utilize both digital hardware and software in the classroom.

","The program will be assessed through pre- and post-surveys. There will also be focus groups and interviews towards the end of the program year. Programs will share pre- and post- data from TABE, CASAS and BEST for learners in order to determine if learners enrolled in IDLL are achieving gains more rapidly than those whom are not enrolled. Learners will be surveyed upon their first course using IDLL technology and then their final course enrolled in using IDLL technology. Instructors will also be surveyed about the amount of technology currently in use in their classroom and teaching methods. The Technology Project Manager will assess the technology capacities of the organization or college where the instructor currently works. The technology assessment of the organization will assist in determining statewide policy initiatives around technology. Most efforts to increase technology usage in adult education have started at the administrative or organizational level.  IDLL is unique in its approach in that it puts adult educators at the center of work. This method of putting the educator at the center of the work will enhance the effectiveness of the program throughout its progression. It will develop leaders in a field where there is a void of full-time positions and CCLC believes this is a critical policy issue in adult education.

The focus of the program is helping adults who are pre-literate or at beginning English levels improve literacy, while providing cultural orientation and preparation for entering the American workforce. The objectives of the alternative to high school program are to provide full day ESL based classes to prepare refugee students for the TASC exam.Quantifiable outcomes:Offer 12 hours of ESL instruction per class, per week. Offer 24 hours of HSE instruction per class, per week.Maintain enrollment at 255 students per year.Improve student's technical literacy so they are prepared to complete digital assessments including the TABE and/or TASC exam.Improve student's English language and literacy skills, as assessed using pretest and posttest scores on the BEST Plus or TABE exam.The goal is for all students to improve by 33 or more points on the BEST Plus, which is considered a 'meaningful educational gain' by the Massachusetts Department of Education's ""Assessment Policies for Using the BEST Plus Test"".

The devices will be primarily used in the youth alternative to high school classes to increase digital literacy, prepare students to take online assessments, teach basic Word processing along with research projects to delve deeper into the content they are learning for TASC preparation, and as the individual teachers see fit to supplement their instruction. Most recently, students put together oral presentations with PowerPoint supporting visuals to present to Journey's End staff and their peers utilizing four outdated laptops, the students expressed great interest in completing additional similar projects in the future that would allow them to practice online research and oral communication skills.

The program offers instruction in six educational functioning levels (EFL): beginning literacy, low beginning, high beginning, low intermediate, high intermediate, and advanced. Civics/citizenship education is also provided. The beginning literacy and low beginning levels, which consist of students with limited English skills, focus on learning the alphabet, basic vocabulary, greetings and introduction. High beginning level students learn the rudiments of English grammar and conversation to communicate with simple sentences and to write short notes, letters, and simple messages. Intermediate level students focus on the development of complex speaking, writing, and reading skills so they can speak clearly and more effectively in various social settings. Advanced level students build upon everything from previous levels and continue to sharpen listening, comprehension, and conversational skills. Through the civics/citizenship education component, students receive instruction in basic U.S. History and Government to prepare students for their U.S. Citizenship exam and interview and teaches them how to exercise rights of citizenship and civic participation.

Due to open enrollment we target 174 students to start, assuming the number will increase to 200 in the year.  Through addition of computer literacy and computer-aided instruction using specialized software we wish to increase their Educational Functioning Level by one whole grade level and to increase their digital literacy competencies.  ","We will be focused on our lower level literacy students in our program to effectively increase the amount of time of direct instruction with the use of computers so that students EFL's, (Educational Functioning Levels) will increase as measured by the TABE assessment. Currently,  students must share a computer lab with other Adult Basic Education and High School Equivalency programs; therefore, they only have access two hours during the week during direct teaching. Purchasing  laptops will address not only learning outcomes but address equity in our program. The Academic and Career Readiness (ACR) program will specifically focus on approximately 200 of our lower level literacy students in Adult Basic Literacy Education (ABLE) and English Language Learners (ELA). ABLE is comprised of Adult Basic Education students who have an intellectual or developmental disability. In the same three classroom spaces, there are three ABLE classes held in the morning and three ABLE classes held in the afternoon. In the evening we have three classes of lower level ELA. All classes have approximately 20 students.  We would like to have a set of laptops that include a larger touch screen for students with visual anomalies as well as students with dexterity issues. This would allow us to share computers and integrate into the classroom. We would then double the time of instruction with computers to four hours a week. This would allow the class to be all-inclusive.","Our program is open enrollment, which means we are always taking in new students. Through our initial TABE testing, we always have a current baseline of the students EFL levels. We would also conduct a pre-survey of student's competencies in digital literacy. We would then be able thru the use of proposed laptops to provide more targeted individual instruction throughout the class periods.  Even though we are focusing on the lower level of literacy objective in these classes, there still is a varied range. For example, some students may be on a 0.5 level and others may be on a 2.3 level. Instructors ideally have direct instruction by grouping students by their level.  While an instructor is providing direct instruction with one group, an assistant in the class could be working with a student on the laptops with programs that we offer that target the student's specific needs.  By increasing the time students can have access to technology-based programs we can address more of their literacy needs as well as incorporate needed technology-based skills that increase employment  or advancement opportunities for these students.  The program would then measure the outcomes by administering the TABE test again to see if the student made an EFL gain. As well as administering a post-survey to see if their abilities to use technology had increased.  There will be a meta-assessment of the outcomes comparing before and after data.  Recommendations will be presented to department heads.",May 2019:Meet with staff to discuss project and assign responsibilities.Purchase laptops and conduct pre-survey of ABLE and ELA students in the classrooms impacted.June 2019- March 2020:Provide contextualized literacy instruction and career exploration including digital literacy skills to use in career pathways.

Throughout the program, we will use these NRS approved tests to track each student's progression while in the program.  Our goal would be to administer the appropriate test to students every 40-100 hours of instruction. Typically our lower level literacy students in both ABE/HSE and ELA need around 60 hours of instruction before we administer the needed test.  In the course of the year, we would plan on assessing students 3 times to measure the effectiveness of the program.  We plan on giving the digital literacy survey 3 times as well, to track the effectiveness of students' competencies with digital literacy.","Our on-campus facilities are equipped with the necessary requirements to use 15 laptops simultaneously.

Students will receive contextualized instruction aligned to the NC Adult Content Standards and meet the thirteen considerations of the Workplace Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA). In addition, we plan on increasing the transition and employment options for populations usually associated with higher unemployment. Due to the structure of our program students need to make EFL gains for our program to maintain its government funding both from the state and the federal level.  We know that any increase in literacy not only improves student performance but allows for momentum for our program to be able to serve more students.  The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that with the integration of technology students can increase learning by almost 50%, however, the barriers to technology remain a problem for students today.

Individual motivation plays a large factor in each student's success and program retention. There are many outside factors impacting student success such as work schedules, immigration status, and family commitments. We have been working to remove barriers and increase motivation through intentional program design. In 2016 we established a summer literacy programming for children of adult English students to remove a significant barrier for young mothers. We have expanded a project to train volunteers to be ""Navigators"" who help ESL students set and reach learning goals. We currently have 3 volunteers who come once a week to set goals with students and then check in with students on a weekly basis. As we see more students struggle to attend classes due to work schedules, we are investigating the options for implementing long-distance learning, in particular for higher level English students who have more job opportunities in the current market. ","Our program is designed to meet the needs of a newly immigrant and highly mobile population. We provide instruction for preliterate to high intermediate language skills. Our pre-literate class meets the unique needs of students who are not literate in their native language, and it has been our largest class for the past two years, indicating a high need. Our textbooks and curriculum contain practical, real-life topics and include interactive computer-based activities to accompany each lesson. During the next program year, we intend to implement a distance learning component to our curriculum. Students will be able to work on internet and application based activities to complete more education hours out of traditional classroom hours. This flexibility along with our open enrollment policy will help improve accessibility for current and potential students.  The majority of working adults in our community have only part-time or temporary work, and job schedules change frequently. All of our teachers are volunteers. New teachers receive 12 hours of training from the Minnesota Literacy Council (MLC) and are required to attend four hours of in-service workshops each year. Last year, 39 volunteer teachers donated 1,627 hours of time. The MLC has also developed a training curriculum for volunteer Navigators. Through access to navigators, the distance learning component, and our open-door policy, we hope to provide students to accessible high-quality English education.","The program evaluation period is from July 1st through June 30th. The time period is set by our partner the Minnesota Literacy Council and was recently changed to match the fiscal year calendar. Classes are offered for 40 weeks throughout the year. Short breaks are taken during the holidays. Each student is offered a minimum of 8 hours of instruction per week.  English classes are offered Monday through Thursday, from 9:30 to11:30 am. Additional hours will be completed every week through the implementation of distance learning options.","Centro uses the U.S. government's standardized Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) exams to assess student progress. Students take CASAS exams every 40 hours of classroom instruction. Teachers administer these exams under the supervision of the program director. Test scores are entered into the Minnesota Literacy Council's online database, which contains reporting capability. The test scores help us monitor student progress and indicate when a student is ready to graduate to the next level of instruction. ","Centro's ELL program currently uses five full-size classrooms, one of which is dedicated as a library/resource center, and two computer labs. The largest classroom has space for up to 16 students, and the smallest classroom has space for up to eight students. Each classroom is equipped with a whiteboard and CD player. Our current curriculum uses the ""Future, English for Results"" language course from Pearson Longman Education. We have teacher's guides and student books for three levels of instruction from Beginner to High-Intermediate (editions from 2010 and 2013). We are in the process of purchasing the latest edition of the ""Future, English for Results"" curriculum to be implemented in the fall of 2019.

Conversely, rates in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights are among the lowest at 3.3 and 3.7 percent respectively.",Data from the 2017 American Community Survey reports Dearborn Heights as having the lowest dropout rate (13 percent) among the cities served by Zaman. Inkster and Dearborn are higher at 16 and 20 percent respectively. All of these exceed the state average of 10 percent.,"According to the 2017 American Community Survey, poverty rates in Inkster, Dearborn, and Dearborn Heights are 33.2, 29.1, and 19.2 percent respectively - all among the highest in the state. This suggests that while the unemployment rates in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights are low, many families are not earning wages high enough to lift them out of poverty.","The data available on the region's literacy rate is debatable, though researchers agree it's very high. The Detroit Regional Workforce Fund published a report saying as many as 47 percent of metro Detroiters are functionally illiterate. As many of Zaman's students are Middle Eastern North African or refugees, they are challenged by low-literacy as well as the need to learn a new language and culture.",,"Through its ESL program, Zaman expects to serve 55 students in the next program year, which begins in September. The program is delivered in one-on-one and small group tutoring sessions as well as online self-study program for Burlington English. Expected outcomes are students enrolling in college or pursuing advanced training, entering the workforce, or starting home-based businesses.",Program objectives are for 77 percent of students to improve their CASAS test score by at least one level; 88 percent will increase their knowledge of US citizenship and involvement in community activities; and 50 percent will increase their involvement in helping children with homework. Zaman defines service as enrolling in the ESL program and receiving at least one hour of instruction. The entire student population is considered at risk because they live at or below the poverty level and/or identify as refugees.,"The BOOST Literacy Program provides volunteer-led, one-on-one and small group tutoring in English as a Second Language (ESL). The program is multi-level and employs different tools to deliver basic, intermediate, and advanced instruction. For students with little to no reading skills, tutors use Laubach Way to Reading. As they advance, Burlington English instructional materials are used teach listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Both curriculums respond to the needs of English learners and native speakers.  Students receive two hours of literacy instruction coupled with two hours of vocational training in sewing or culinary arts twice per week. The course schedule is designed to accommodate parents and is aligned with the academic year taking place Monday through Friday, between 9:30 AM and 3:30 PM, from September to May. Students attend an orientation that describes the program curriculum, timeline, and expectations. Tutors are trained rigorously on the needs of adult learners, curriculum delivery, and teaching to accomplish student goals. BOOST's literacy coordinator is available on-site to offer tutors guidance on lesson plans and resource utilization.",The BOOST Literacy Program is 32 weeks and follows the Dearborn Public Schools academic calendar with a fall and winter semester. A summer enrichment program is offered in August. Outcomes are measured following the completion of one semester of students obtaining four hours of weekly literacy instruction and four hours of weekly vocational training.,"Measurable results can easily be obtained through pre- and post-program test results. Program success, including the impact of the materials, is evaluated by: 1) attendance/retention which permits students to have only two excused absences and two unexcused absences; 2) CASAS testing which is conducted at the beginning of each semester to establish baseline data and after 40 hours of instruction; 3) mid-term evaluations which consist of instructor-led assessments testing material covered to date, short conversation, and grammar portions; 4) student/tutor conferences which the Literacy Coordinator conducts end-of-semester conferences with each student and tutor to evaluate progress and make recommendations for further literacy instruction; and 5) goal setting which utilizes a quantitative survey instrument for evaluating improvements in English/literacy skills, family and financial outlook, social interaction, and personal feeling of well-being.","All classes take place at Zaman's Hope for Humanity Center, a 40,500 square-foot facility in Inkster, Michigan. It is home to the crisis assistance center, which provides wraparound services in the form of case management, food, clothing, and household items. A fully equipped teaching kitchen and classroom spaces for sewing and literacy instruction are also located in the center. ESL classes are supported by 12 desktop computers and 20 laptops as well as books, areas for one-on-one and group discussion, and AV equipment for video presentations.",Zaman uses 12 desktops and 20 laptops for ESL instruction. The average age of all equipment is five years.,Yes,"As class sizes grow, Zaman started to experience regular fluctuations in internet connectivity. These happen throughout the day and are particularly disruptive when class is in session. Wi/fi and internet access are essential to delivering the ESL program as the Burlington materials are web-based. To overcome this, tutors often print hard copies of the exercises. However, this places the students at a disadvantage because it limits their access to the fullness of Burlington's platform, which includes modules on resume development, job search techniques, CASAS practice exams, and civics lessons. Further, so many transactions take place online, it's critical that students be comfortable interacting with web-based applications. Outside of class time, students can visit Zaman's computer lab. For some participants, it is their primary source for internet access, and when it's not functional, they can't complete classroom assignments or explore other learning tools that contribute to their training.The disruptions are caused by a number of factors and in order to correct them, Zaman's network has to be re-configured requiring the time of content experts, hardware, and software. As it interferes with direct delivery of services, improving internet access is an organizational priority.

Projections include an estimated total of adult learners from ABE, ESL and HSE classes. CLC instructors will use a phonics-based, modified Spaulding curriculum which is proven to be most effective with struggling learners. In addition, the LEAP Program will pilot Edmentum at two HSE sites. Our organization anticipates improvements in reading, spelling and increased self-esteem among adult learners. ","CLC is working diligently to meet the growing demand for our Adult Basic Education (ABE), English as a Second Language (ESL) and High School Equivalency (HSE) services. To ensure the effectiveness of our program, the Education Program Coordinator will continue to assess and monitor growth for core programs at each of our LEAP sites. This individual will make sure that our students are assessed when they enroll in our classes to determine their skill level and they will be reassessed at quarterly intervals to monitor progress. We will also survey our students and volunteer tutors to determine their levels of satisfaction with our program. As the largest community-based literacy program in the state of Oklahoma, we will serve up to 1,000 individuals annually with the goal of improving literacy skills and self efficacy.To ensure that we are meeting the needs of our partners, we will meet with them quarterly to discuss the progress of the program and make any needed adjustments. The Education Program Coordinator and ESL Specialist regularly visit the classrooms to assist and coach our teachers and tutors implementing best practices into our program. CLC recognizes the vital role that technology plays in facilitating multiple avenues of learning in the classroom, therefore, we will pilot Edmentum in two HSE classes in the Fall of 2020. Edmentum can potentially raise learner achievement with adaptive assessments and prescribe content to personalize learning. ","The Education Program Coordinator will facilitate the operation of LEAP sites and effectively monitor program activities. The Coordinator will formulate curriculum and select instructional materials that address the specific needs of adult learners. It is imperative that CLC continue to evaluate participant feedback so that we may improve our methods of instruction in the classroom. Currently, CLC instructors use Steck-Vaughn and Wilson instructional materials for our ABE students while Step Forward is used for instruction in ESL classes. CLC will pilot Edmentum at two HSE sites during the 2019-2020 fiscal year. Edmentum allows instructors to customize assessments for specific and direct instruction. The system is intuitive and capable of identifying the right content at the right time. With so many of our adult learners reading or speaking English at different levels and at various locations, the ability to provide individualised learning paths (rather than the teacher having to do the learning path for each student, and each class) will prove to be more efficient.Currently, our organization administers the WRAT (Wide Range Achievement Test) to basic literacy and HSE students and an updated version of the REST (Real English Skills Test) to ESL students. Up to date assessments and office materials will help ensure that students and teachers have the proper tools necessary to enhance learning in the classroom.

CLC will pilot the web-based Edmentum curriculum at CEO (Center for Employment Opportunities) and our HSE (High School Equivalency) classes from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. ","CLC administers pre-and post assessments and surveys to all ESL and ABE students quarterly to determine each level of need and to monitor the progress of the LEAP program. These assessments provide feedback on individuals and classes in order to assist teachers in finding and filling gaps in knowledge. Beyond assessing students, CLC administers surveys to students to determine the satisfaction levels among students and to gauge the services provided by the LEAP program.CLC will continue to formulate instruction based on the needs of our learners and evaluate progress through the regular administration of pre-and post-assessments and surveys. Currently, our organization administers the WRAT (Wide Range Achievement Test) to basic literacy classes and a new version of the REST (Real English Skills Test), developed by graduate students at Oklahoma City University, to ESL classes. In addition, CLC is a registered HiSET testing center and will be administering the exam several times throughout the year for both CLC students and others. We will pilot the Edmentum prescriptive assessments and curriculum in all of our HSE classes. CLC uses spreadsheets to track client information including assessment scores and survey results. ","CLC is unique in its ability to adapt to the needs of our adult learners and community partners. Because we collaborate with organizations to provide classroom space we are able to reach more individuals in Oklahoma County, eliminating barriers such as transportation. Operating in multiple locations with a variety of class times outside of the conventional 40 hour work week, CLC maximizes the potential to reach those adults in need while minimizing cost.Our organization is in active collaboration with 26 partner agencies: fifteen Oklahoma City Public Schools, several libraries, non-profit organizations, correctional facilities, churches, and one local business.

Indeed, Cicero Illinois is also a manufacturing hub for Chicago and thus attracts immigrant families seeking middle-skilled employment. In Cook County, the average earning of Latino families is $23,900. Through an employment lens, these numbers suggest that residents of Cicero Illinois could be better classified as the working poor (underemployed) rather than as job-seekers (unemployed). ","LUF's (former LAMDA) literacy and numeracy program serves low-income families that hold low-skilled jobs. Only 60% of our caregivers have completed elementary school and over 90% speak only Spanish. The language barrier impedes program participants from having full access to strategies on caregiving. This, in turn, limits access to resources for patients with Alzheimer's. This program provides a contextualized curriculum that implements caregiving in its literacy and numeracy program.  ","According to city data of 2015, nearly 25% of Cicero Illinois residents live below the poverty level, higher than the State's median of 18%. Still, Cicero Illinois does have a low unemployment rate of 7.9% when compared to the State. This data indicates the high concentration of working poor families in the vicinity. With an average wage of $23,900, this data indicates the high numbers of families employed in occupations that pay low wages.  ","Cicero Illinois  is in dire need of literacy and numeracy programs. Cicero Illinois High School drop-out rate, for example, is 33% (Illinois' rate is 12%) and only 11% of the population have a bachelor's degree or higher (Illinois has 33%). Further, LUF attracts mostly individuals that only speak Spanish. These numbers unfortunately do not speak to numeracy levels. Based on LUF's experience, most program participants that seek services score below a 4.0 in the math test.  ",,"LUF enrolls 110 participants per year through 6 cohorts (3 semesters each year: 3 morning and 3 evening classes). LUF enrolls participants with reading and math levels of at least 4.0-6.0 and advances them at least 1.5 levels within a semester (140 hours of instruction). Participants generally increase their levels of reading and math, and their caregiving skills (participants have to learn body mass index, dosage and medications, and present a respite care plan). ","Of the 110 enrolled (unduplicated numbers), at least 85 will complete the course and advance 1.5 levels in either reading and/or math. Of the 110, 60 are expected to enroll in beginners (4.0-5.0), 30 in intermediate (5.0-6.0), and 20 in Advanced/Conversation. Across all levels, LAMDA expects at least 80% to complete and advance to the next level (48 for beginners, 24 for intermediate, and 16 for advanced). LUF administers a pre-test, mid-term, and final assessment to measure participants' skill levels. Curricula across all levels have been contextualized to include caregiving skill-building. For example, the intermediate course's final project includes a math project on body mass index (BMI) and medications, while the advanced course requires a final presentation to respite care planning. Of the 85 participants that complete the course, at least 75 will report scheduling and showing up to a doctor's visit. Additionally, LUF's program connects caregivers to other resources available through the Illinois Department of Aging. Some caregivers (19 in the last program year), pursue a career pathways as Home Care Aides after completing the program at LUF. We are currently establishing a partnership with Morton Community College to transition some participants to coursework and training in healthcare. All 19 students are currently enrolled in prerequisite work (Anatomy and Medical Terminology) at Morton College. ","LUF offers contextualized education in the field of healthcare and caregiving to program participants. LUF offers three levels: beginners, intermediate, and advanced. All three levels include a numeracy component which is contextualized to concepts in biology and anatomy, and billing and payments. For example, students learn math through concepts of body mass index and milligrams in aspirins. LUF employs 4 instructors and offers classes out of 2 locations (both in Cicero Illinois). LUF has close connections with the Cicero District and uses its Field House for evening classes. Additionally, LUF partners with local elementary schools, and provides a beginners course at that site. LUF has seen that some students that enroll in the literacy/numeracy classes are interested in pursuing a career as In Home Healthcare Aides. Recently, LUF partnered with Triton Community College located in the nearby suburb of River Grove to connect program participants to their Healthcare Aide program. This is a relatively short program that can equip participants with skills and certifications to provide professional caregiving to loved ones and other patients. Last year LUF connected 26 program participants. Based on feedback from students, we are now modifying our curriculum to include concepts in medical terminology and contextualize our literacy program with concepts of Anatomy and Physiology. For classes, LUF offers onsite activity programs for seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia. ","LUF operates on a semester schedule and provides classes on Autumn, Spring, and Summer. Because we have less demand for advanced classes, LUF only offers this class on Autumn and Spring. As students' skills increase, LUF advances students to its higher level classes. All classes meet Monday-Thursday from either 9am-11:30am, or from 6pm-8:30pm for a total of 14 weeks. LUF administers a midterm test on week 6 to measure student progress. If the student lags on a specific subject, LUF partners with a community-based agency, Erie Neighborhood House, to provide volunteer tutoring services. Tutoring services meet on Saturday mornings and program is coordinated by LUF. Of the 110 students total that LUF will enroll, 85 will complete at least one level and advance 1.5 levels in either literacy or numeracy.

The largest part of our program is housed at AAMA headquarters where we dedicated space as well as space that we share with the charter school.This past program year, we had the need to relocate our sites in the Northside, due to Harvey damage at one of our sites. The HCC Acres Home campus has accommodated our needs and St. Leo the Great Catholic Church has also provided classrooms at no cost to us. Both sites provide furnishings and allow us to bring our technology. ","The main site at the Gulf Freeway is equipped with a computer lab, 24 computers, dedicated to the Adelante program. The equipment for Adelante is usually 'handed down' from the charter school, but is in good condition. Through a multi-year Comcast grant we were able to purchase laptop carts for our remote sites and an additional cart for the Gulf Freeway location.

This is in contrast to the unemployment rate for the three communities with the greatest number of VEP students--West Chester is 4%, Coatesville is 4.7%, and Phoenixville is 8.4%. 65% of VEP students are employed, however many are underemployed due to language and cultural barriers. 80% of VEP students are women. ","Students may start the program any time during the year and are asked to make a 1 year commitment. The flexibility of scheduling does not lend itself to tracking a dropout rate, however we do track retention rates. In the past year, just 3% of students had to leave the program due to commitments to family, employment, health issues or moving out of the area. Our instructional model supports student retention because the flexibility of the program allows for brief interruptions in service.","Pockets of poverty exist in the three primary regions served by VEP. The poverty level in Coatesville is 30.1%;  Phoenixville is 9.1%; and West Chester is 27.0% (American Community Survey, 2017). Of current VEP students, 55% are at or below established poverty levels. This is in contrast to Chester County, PA, which is considered one of the wealthiest counties in Pennsylvania with a median household income level of $92,656 and an overall poverty rate of 3.6% (American Community Survey, 2017).","In Chester County, 93.3% of adults 25 or older graduated high school and 52.2% have a bachelor's degree or higher (American Community Survey, 2017). 70% of VEP students report having graduated from high school in their native countries. Of those, more than 50% have a bachelor's degree or higher. One of VEP's challenges is comparing the equivalency of education in other countries to the U.S. and helping students meet certification requirements for employment in their career fields.",,"334 students will receive English language instruction from volunteer tutors. Instruction will take place 3 hrs/wk for a minimum of one year. VEP staff will assess students, and lessons will be tailored to student's proficiency level, needs, and personal goals. VEP staff research appropriate level books, provide initial books to tutors and students at no cost. 200 students will advance one proficiency level after 144 hours of instruction. 200 students will attain1 personal goal within 1 year.","By providing free instructional books and resource materials that reflect 21st century content and techniques to support one-to-one tutoring for adult English language learners, VEP will eliminate financial barriers for students who are desperate to increase English proficiency and attain personal goals that include employment, education, financial stability, personal independence, and citizenship. It is estimated that 80 new students will be matched with as many new tutors this year. With an average cost for an adult ESL text of $30, the expense is doubled for each student-tutor pair. By providing books to students and new tutors, the following outcomes will be achieved: 1. 80 new students will be interviewed, assessed, and matched with one-to-one tutors and receive free books based on current proficiency levels and targeting specific goals. 2. 200 continuing students will be reassessed after 144 hours of instruction and demonstrate growth toward the next level of English language proficiency on a CASAS test. Their tutors will have free access to a library of instructional books that meet their student's improving proficiency levels. 3. 200 new and continuing students will progress toward a personal goal within one year of instruction. Tutors record progress toward personal goals through our online tutor portal management system. ","The project implementation design is as follows: 1. VEP staff research,  vet and manage inventory of all instructional books and resource materials for adult English Language Learners. 2. Each new student is interviewed by a staff member and takes a standardized assessment to determine current English proficiency levels. This information is used to select appropriate level books for teaching vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension, pronunciation, and/or writing. 3. VEP staff match each student with a a volunteer tutor. Students are given their first consumable book for free. Tutors borrow a companion book that they are encouraged to return through a lending library model. Other materials that focus on job skills, GED preparation, and citizenship are also made available. 4. As students progress, tutors may borrow new books at no cost while students are asked to pay a nominal fee for additional consumable workbooks. 5. VEP staff reassess students after a minimum of 70 hours of instruction to track growth. 6. Tutors report progress toward student goals using an online tutor portal data management system.","The program has a rolling enrollment which means students may begin working with a tutor at any time during the year. Once tutors and students are matched, staff provide each student-tutor pair with free companion texts for use during the 3 hours of instruction per week. After every 70 hours of instruction, VEP staff contact students to take a progress assessment. Tutors update student goals in the tutor portal data management system throughout the year. When additional books and resources are needed, tutors consult with VEP staff who then recommend and distribute the books. Staff track progress and analyze data on an ongoing basis.","Assessment takes place at defined intervals throughout the program: at an individual's entry into the program, after every 70 hours of tutor instruction, and at exit from program.To track the education gains, the CASAS series is used to assess English proficiency levels. It is administered based upon the defined levels of assessment following the Appraisal Form 80. The BEST test is used as an intake assessment for students with limited English literacy. In addition to these measurement tools, VEP also conducts a comprehensive scope of service assessment at the defined intervals. This assessment measures reading, writing, comprehension, speaking and listening, which further aligns individuals' needs with organizational resources.  ","Books are stored at the VEP office. The assessment of students and matching them with tutors takes place at the office or off-site at a location provided by one of our VEP partners, such as a public library or other location that offers free, confidential space close to tutors and students home or work communities. ","Tutors and students utilize their own laptops, tablets, or cellphones during direct instruction as needed. Others may access public computers in local libraries and our United Way partner's Financial Stability Center. VEP provides tutors free access to online subscriptions for ELL resources, such as ProLiteracy.

Six Hundred seventy-seven ESOL students will be served through small group instruction on life skills and verbal skills.,"Literacy Works @ JPL saw a four percent increase in Beginning Literacy level English language learners assessed during the 2018 fiscal year. Increased demand for Beginning Literacy level classes came at the same time local refugee agencies experienced a reduction in staff. Local refugee resettlement agencies have been impacted by the drop in refugees coming to Jacksonville; there were 873 refugees resettled in 2018 compared to the 1,385 in 2016.     An unemployment rate of 19% and a poverty rate of 14.45% in the areas where JPL offers ESOL instruction adds to the need for free English language instruction. The English Language learner spends an average of six months with the library's ESOL program before leaving the program for employment opportunity or family needs. Additional training is imperative for instructors to ensure the Beginning Literacy learner has the basic foundation to move to the next level. Each year JPL relies on volunteers to provide small group instruction at the Main and four branch libraries. In the past the volunteers worked only with the Low Beginning level classes or higher. JPL needs approximately 36 volunteers a semester to cover classes. In 2018, over 1,000 ESOL classes were taught by volunteers throughout the JPL system who contributed 1,965.5 hours to Library ESOL programming with JPL. The Independent Sector.org estimated the value of volunteer time in 2016 to be $24.14 an hour, which would amount to $47,447.17 of in-kind valuable work.","JPL's ESOL program offers small group instruction to Low Beginning through Proficient Skills English Language Learners, including traditional classroom (five levels) and conversation groups (High Beginning to Proficient Skills). Low Beginning classes are offered only at Main Library. Reduction in services offered by local refugee agencies has created demand for more Beginning Literacy classes at JPL. The Center for Adult Learning plans to offer Beginning Literacy classes at four branch locations and Main Library. The need for additional classes can only be met with more volunteer instructors and additional classroom resources.2019 curriculum will focus on Total Physical Response (TPR)--a method of teaching language/vocabulary concepts through physical movement.

The tutor engages in multisensory teaching to convey curricular content in the most understandable way to the student. The tutor also models how the student, by using these multiple pathways, can engage in multisensory learning that results in greater ease and success in learning. It is Direct Instruction The tutor presentations employ lesson formats which ensure that the student approaches the learning experience understanding what is to be learned, why it is to be learned, and how it is to be learned. It draws upon applied linguistics not only in the initial decoding and encoding stages of reading and writing but in more advanced stages dealing with syllabic, morphemic, syntactic, semantic, and grammatic structures of language and our writing system. At all times the Orton-Gillingham Approach involves the student in integrative practices that involve reading, spelling, and writing together. It increases linguistic competence by stressing language patterns that determine word order and sentence structure and the meaning of words and phrases. It moves beyond this to recognizing the various forms that characterize the common literary forms employed by writers. The Tutor presents information in an ordered way that indicates the relationship between the material taught and past material taught.  ","The projected timeline for this grant project will be July 1, 2019 through June 30th 2020.

The weekly instructional hours for each student will be 2 hours minimum twice a week in an hour increment at each session. ","The Tutoring session is both diagnostic and prescriptive. It is diagnostic in the sense that the tutor continuously monitors the verbal, nonverbal, and written responses of the student to identify and analyze both the student's problems and progress. This information is the basis of planning the next lesson.

","The drop-out rate was 1.95% for Orange County Schools and .77% for Chapel Hill/Carrboro Schools in the 2016-17 academic year, the most recent for which data is available on the NC Department of Public Instruction website.","14.5% of all people living in Orange County are in poverty, according to the 2017 estimate by the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. ","The National Center for Education Statistics estimated that 9% of the adults in Orange County lacked basic prose literacy skills in 2003, the most recent year for which nation-wide data was collected. In 2016, the American Community Survey estimated that 3.7% of adults in Orange County had not completed the 9th grade, an additional 4% had completed 9th grade but never graduated high school, and 16.7% spoke a language other than English at home.",,"We will offer targeted computer skills to existing students of varying levels of literacy and English proficiency. Classes will be broken into a series of 10 4-week modules, each with a max of 10 students. While this provides for a max participation of 100, we anticipate many students will enroll in multiple modules. Each module will build on the preceding module. In addition to improving student comfort and proficiency with computers, we also expect to improve literacy and/or English.","Each module will build toward its own final project. For example:A folder with saved files for Basic Skills moduleA brief research report for Searching the Internet moduleAt least one resume or cover letter saved as MS Word and PDF for Resumes and Cover Letters modulesBesides giving students confidence in the application of the skills they wish to learn, these projects will allow the instructor to assess the strength of the instruction and correct any areas of confusion.","Numerous adult students in our ESOL and  ABE Programs have asked for assistance with computer skills. A major challenge to providing these classes is that students across programs have varying levels of literacy (in any language) as well as English proficiency. Similarly, students at comparable levels of literacy or English proficiency have differing comfort levels with computers and technology. It is a challenge to create a class where all of these factors neatly align. And because we work county-wide, times and locations are an issue.We hope to mitigate this challenge in two ways: 1) by only enrolling students who are current OL students, and; 2) by limiting each module to content that will be manageable for a mix of students.For example, the Basic Skills Module will appeal to lower level ESOL students and intermediate (pre-GED) ABE students, and focus on using a mouse and  keyboard, opening folders and applications and saving and moving files. It would also cover basic computer vocabulary as well as typing skills including punctuation and capitalization.A module on writing cover letters will be more useful for high intermediate and advanced ESOL students as well as GED level ABE students. This module will focus on formatting (and naming) a presentable cover letter in MS Word or Google Docs and useful keywords for job-seekers. Where necessary, it will also cover general language skills such as past tense (previous experience) and future tense (career aspirations).","Our first step is to identify interested students in our ESOL and ABE programs. We have already surveyed our ESOL classes asking what computer skills they would like to learn. These surveys indicate that evenings work best for most interested students, and we will start with Tuesday and Thursday from 6pm-8pm. We will have the flexibility to change the schedule for later modules to other days and times in response to student needs.At our office in Carrboro, NC we will offer one module each month, except December and June, for a total of 10 modules. Each module will meet for 2 hours twice a week for 4 weeks for a total of 16 instructional hours.We have discussed with Orange County Schools the possibility of offering computer skills classes in public K-12 schools in the evenings. Ideally we will duplicate the modules held here in our office at an OCS location, either concurrently with our office program or on a slightly different schedule.The first module will cover basic skills. From there, we will be flexible in designing modules to meet the expressed needs of our students. If several students want to improve their employment, we can offer modules on resumes and cover letters. If students are more interested in the personal use of technology - using email and paying bills online - we can cover those areas instead. We can also repeat the basic skills module if more students come forward with that expressed need.","All ESOL students enrolled in the computer classes will have been previously pre-tested in CASAS Life and Work Reading and/or Listening as part of their regular intake. All ABE students will have been pre-tested in TABE 9 and 10 Reading and/or Math as part of their regular intake. (Pre-tests will be in TABE 11 and 12 after April 2, 2019.) We expect students in the computer skills modules to show gains in their CASAS or TABE scores higher than their peers who are not in the modules.We are also exploring the Northstar Digital Literacy Assessment, a set of 10 free digital literacy assessments created by the Minnesota Literacy Council. These assessments test skills and knowledge that we do not presently anticipate covering, such as hard and soft buttons on phones and tablets. They also appear to be tailored specifically towards ABE students, as opposed to ESOL students. Nonetheless, we are optimistic they will capture the progress that students make in terms of their computer skills.","Orange Literacy has a designated computer lab onsite as well as several classroom spaces and Chromebooks to use for the computer modules.We have also been in discussion with Orange County Schools about using the computer labs in the schools, although this presents certain challenges unique to working in a K-12 school environment. Namely, computers and internet in schools are heavily restricted in terms of connecting to websites as well as the applications that can be installed on OCS machines. We have also considered setting up hotspots and using Chromebooks in this setting.","We currently have 7 desktop computers in our onsite computer lab designated for student use. These machines are less than 10 years old and are all running Windows 10. We also have 21 Chromebooks (Samsung), 4 pocket projectors, 2 large projectors, 2 Sprint Mi-Fi hotspots, and assorted accessories such as USB mice and keyboards.For the computer skills modules, each student will be given access to a computer during class time. This can be a desktop or a Chromebook, depending on the setting as well as the content being covered. Additionally, the instructor will have access to a computer and a projector so that he/she can model skills for the class. Internet will also be available to accommodate instruction on topics that require or work best with the internet. Access to the internet will also allow seamless sharing of files via email or a cloud-storage service such as Google Drive.",No,,"$15,040.00 ","$15,040.00 ","We are requesting funding for the following:Curriculum Development - Although we have a general outline of the skills we would like to cover, we will need to develop detailed lesson plans tailored to the specific technology available in one or more settings. This curriculum should be flexible enough to respond to the expressed and observed needs of our students, but also structured enough to adequately cover the targeted skills in relatively short instructional time.Instructors - Instructors for both the Carrboro and Hillsborough location.  Each module will include instruction for 2 hours, twice weekly for 4 weeks. We plan to pilot 10 modules in 2 locations each.Travel - Instructors and staff will be reimbursed at the standard IRS rate for the use of personal vehicles when driving between our office and the offsite class location.16GB USB 2.0 flash drives X 20 - Not all students in all modules will need a flash drive, but we will provide them to those who do.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mansfield had an unemployment rate of 5 percent in January 2018.  This is substantially higher than Ohio's 4.3 percent unemployed and the national figure of 4 percent for the same time period.   ","According to state and district figures, Mansfield City Schools has a 23 percent dropout rate, which is markedly high compared to Ohio and national averages of 4.3 and 3.5 percent, respectively. This rate is affected by a variety of factors, including teen pregnancies, crime and poverty. Under the state of Ohio's rating system for schools, Mansfield Senior High School met only seven of 12 possible standards for the 2017-2018 academic year.","According to U.S. Census Bureau, 18.7 percent of Mansfield's households are below the federal poverty level and 17.8 percent of all Mansfield households received public assistance in the past 12 months.   ","According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, Mansfield has a population with 10 percent lacking Basic Prose Literacy Skills.   ",,"Every fiscal year, Solutions seeks to serve 140 students through individualized plans of study in reading, math and language. NCSC tutors and the Solutions Coordinator instruct and guide students through their plans. Expected outcomes","As the scope of student needs continues to grow, Solutions is finding new ways to collaborate with students, advisors, instructors, and partners. Originally conceived as a program for pre-enrolled students, Solutions' reach has expanded to 1) enrolled students who are having difficulty passing their developmental education classes, 2) GED students whose schedules do not permit attending regular GED classes, 3) students from other institutions who are brushing up skills for future classes, 4) secondary education students seeking tutoring for classes and preparation for state standardized testing, and 5) adults preparing for a variety of paraprofessional, professional, and military-entrance assessments. Solutions' main objective is to bridge skill gaps in this growing student base.  Another objective is to save students money. Because the program is free to anyone, with no course or textbook fees, many Solutions students can save financial aid dollars and reduce out-of-pocket costs. Solutions' most important objective is retention. Every student's individual plan emphasizes skill acquisition. Progress is recorded and plans are complete only when students demonstrate measurable competency in conceptual knowledge and application. Solutions students is 55%, but for North Central State students is 44%.  This allows them to start at a higher level academically, saving them time and money, and 92% of students pass the higher level class they test into. ","Students may be referred to Solutions through NCSC's testing specialist, an academic advisor, a course instructor, a college administrator, or from any member of our partner organizations. To enroll in Solutions, students attend an orientation during which they take an assessment to determine skill gaps in reading, writing, and math. The Solutions Coordinator evaluates the assessment and develops an Individualized Learning Plan (ILP) to address the skill gaps. The coordinator then schedules a follow-up meeting with the student where this plan is discussed. The orientation and follow-up meetings are both opportunities for the student and coordinator to discuss the program in detail and to establish rapport.Students set their own Solutions schedule, 2-3 days per week, 2-3 hours per day. A student may opt to attend more days per week or for more hours a day, but the student is encouraged to take regular breaks to help aid retention of material. Solutions students are not separated from other students in the Tutoring and Resource Center. They attend their tutoring sessions at the same tables where enrolled students are getting help for their regular coursework. This provides excellent opportunities for Solutions students to acclimate to the college environment and to start networking with students from their chosen major. From their first Solutions session to the day they complete their ILPs, tutors help students establish and maintain a process of study.",The program began in January 2009 due to a grant that was obtained by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The grant ends in June and further funding is needed. We hope to obtain further funding to continue to support these students.,"The Solutions Program utilizes the TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) for initial assessment and to assess measurable skills gains. Scores are regularly reported to Richland County Aspire and to North Central State College. The Solutions Coordinator and Solutions Tutors may also devise reviews of their own, or from other materials, to assess competency in specific concepts. Solutions plans to move to the new computer version of TABE 11 and 12 in the coming academic year. By NCSC placement testing policy, students who enroll in Solutions with a Next Gen Accuplacer score of 236 or below are considered ""Solutions Mandatory"" and are asked to focus on reading and language concepts until they can boost their reading score out of mandatory status. Before placement testing and re-testing, Solutions students must reach benchmarks for attendance, TABE Level, and ILP completion. Once all of these benchmarks are met, the Coordinator refers the student to Accuplacer Testing. ","NCSC provides the facility for this program. Tables, chairs, computers, books, paper, pencils, binders, testing materials, teaching materials, and Manager of the program will be provided throughout the life of this program.","The students in this program have access to sixteen computers with Microsoft, internet, email, Read/Write, CoWriter, Key Boarding Pro, and various others installed for their use.
